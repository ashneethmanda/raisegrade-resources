     The first part of Unit 1 looks at how economics defines itself as a social science and studies
    / complex economic behaviour. It looks at the central economic problem of scarcity and how
     economic systems and agents make choices between competing alternatives. Some basic
=    terms are introduced. The idea of markets and the role of money in the workings of an economic
     system is developed. Finally, the different types of economies — free market, mixed and
     command — are examined, along with a first look at the role of the state.

economies work. But they also want to influence
policy debates. Normative economics also typically
contains positive economics within it. Take the
normative statement ‘The government should increase
the state pension’. Economists putting forward this
value judgement are likely to back up their opinion
with positive evidence. They might state that ‘The
average pensioner has a disposable income of 40
per cent of the average worker’ and ‘The average
pensioner only goes on holiday once every four years’.
These are positive statements because they are
capable of being proven or disproven. They are used
to build up an argument that supports the final opinion
that state pensions should be raised.
   Normative statements tend to contain words like
‘should’ and ‘ought’. However, sometimes positive
statements also contain these words. ‘Inflation should
be brought down’ is a normative statement because
it is not capable of being refuted. ‘Inflation should

system dramatically’.
  By comparison, the USA spends 5.22 per cent of its
GDP on education, Germany 4.95 per cent and the UK
5.72 per cent. The United Nations wants countries to
spend at least 6 per cent of their GDP on education.
  If India increases its spending on education, it
could become a major supplier of skilled and qualified
workers to the rest of the world, given the population
advantage that it has. With over 315 million students, it
has the largest number of pupils in the world.
  The paper also noted that the educational sector
in India faced major challenges, including a lack
of teachers. At present, the shortage of teachers
has been measured at 1.4 million. There are also
concerns that some teachers do not measure up to
the standards of the National Council for Teachers’
Education (NCTE).
  Also, because of an absence of focus on effective
skill development, India is one of the least skilled
countries. The paper said that only 4.7 per cent of the
work force has any formal training, whereas the figure
is 80 per cent for Japan, 95 per cent for South Korea,
75 per cent for Germany, 68 per cent for UK and 52
per cent for the USA.




 EXAM HINT

Think of the main points about which you could write. These could include an increase in demand for more
qualified Indian workers and the impact on their incomes. Indian businesses may become more competitive,
 more foreign companies may set up in India and this may have a beneficial impact on the Indian economy in
terms of GDP and tax revenues.
   You may then consider some of the possible drawbacks, such as where the extra money will come from,
what other sectors of government spending may have to be cut to provide the funding, how long this will take
to have an impact and the question of whether extra spending by itself will be enough to raise standards.

THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

After A levels, students will have to decide whether to stay on in education,
typically by doing a three-year university degree, or whether to try to find a job.
   The opportunity costs of going to university are the lost benefits from
the next best alternative. Getting a job at age 18 is not guaranteed, but
if students can get a job they will be able to earn a wage and enjoy the
spending power that goes with it. They are likely, in those three years, to
have more money than their friends who have gone to university.
   University students will miss out on three years of income, which they
could have been earning, and will often build up a student debt to pay for
tuition fees and their living expenses during this period. A study by the OECD,
using data from the academic year 2008/09, highlighted the considerable
differences in tuition fees charged to students across 25 countries in the
world. The four countries with the highest average tuition fees were the USA,
Korea, the UK and Japan. Some of the cheapest tuition fees included Sweden,
Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland. However, there are often well-
developed student support schemes in the countries who charge the most,
so students have access to grants and/or student loan schemes. In the UK,
student loans are only paid back once earnings are above £21,000 per year.
   However, data suggests that even with these debts, students on average will have more money over their
lifetime. This is true even after any student debt has been taken from total earnings and the three years of
potential earnings has been discounted. A report based on US data from the College Board, ‘Education Pays
2013: The Benefits of Higher Education for Individuals and Society’, states that in 2011 median earnings of
individuals with an undergraduate degree were on average US$21,100 higher than those who did not continue
their education after age 18. Graduates are also more likely to be employed, have better health and enjoy the
experience. The opportunity costs of going to university — the lost benefits — are often lower than the lifetime
rewards of being a graduate, even with rising tuition fees.

THE NHS FACING TOUGH CHOICES
The National Health Service in the UK is one of the
best in the world on international ratings. It is funded
by the government through taxation.
   However, this does not mean that tough choices do
not have to be made. Politicians and health managers
need to be more honest with the public, according to
Sir Andrew Dillon, the head of NICE (National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence). It is the responsibility
of NICE to decide which drugs are value for money
and can be offered by the NHS and which drugs will
not be available to NHS patients.
  In 2014, NICE ruled that two cancer drugs that
extend lives — Zytiga R for prostate cancer and Kadcyla
R for breast cancer — were not cost effective for the
NHS, and were therefore rejected by the agency.               Sir Andrew Dillon said: ‘The NHS has to exercise

THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

WATER SHORTAGES
In many circumstances, water is a free good. It falls
from the sky or can be collected from rivers with no
opportunity cost. However, with the world’s population
predicted to rise to over 11   billion, water is becoming
an ever scarcer resource in many countries.
  Scarcity is being felt not just by consumers but
also by producers. For example, the world’s oil and
gas supplies could be transformed by the relatively
new process of fracking — forcing liquid through rocks
to release oil and a gas called ‘shale’ trapped in the
rocks. But each US well (deep hole containing oil,
water or gas) requires on average 2 million gallons
(1 gallon = around 4.5 litres) of water to extract all
the oil or gas in the well. Many wells are in areas of
relative water shortage. Hence, Antero Resources,

 CASE STUDY: BLACK FRIDAY

 Black Friday is an American import. In America, on the last Friday of November, shops offer large discounts to
 encourage customers to spend and since 2013, UK retailers have copied the idea. In 2014, some supermarkets
 got more than they planned. The Financial Times reported that police were called to at least seven Tesco stores
 in the Manchester area after fights took place between customers competing for the bargains on offer. Online,
 websites for Tesco, Currys and Argos all struggled. Currys, the electrical retailer, left shoppers on its website
 waiting up to one hour in a virtual queue.

Kapital, the first part of which was published in 1867.
He correctly saw that there was a great gap between
the economic fortunes of the owners of property and
workers in 19th-century Europe. He wanted to see
that gap eliminated. He developed a theory which
said that it was historically inevitable that workers, the
proletariat, would rise up in revolution against property
owners and seize control of the means of production.
Anew democratic society would arise, which would
lead to equality and where property would be owned by
everyone collectively. Karl Marx, although he advocated
revolution, would probably not have approved of the
Marxist state created by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet
Union in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The problem
for Marxists was how to go from a capitalist free market
economy to an ideal economy in which somehow
everyone owned everything to the benefit of all. Joseph
Stalin solved this problem by creating a command
economy where the state owned most resources.
Command economies ultimately have not been anywhere

 section looks xconsumer behaviour. It examines what it means to make rational
choices and why consumers may not always be rational. Demand, one of the key concepts
in economics, is introduced: what it is, what shapes it and how it can be represented in
diagrams. It also looks at the various factors that can cause a shift in demand. Elasticity
explores the degree to which changes in other variables, including price, income and the price
of other goods, affects the level of demand. Elasticity of demand includes calculations and the
interpretation of the numerical results.

     In 2014, the Financial Times reported that the
     budget airline company, Ryanair, had seen a fall in
     its net profits over the preceding 12 months. The
     company was quoted as saying that the results were

     shareholders expect their companies to maximise
     profits. In the case of Ryanair, the company has

     is based on low prices and low costs. By having
     lower costs than most of its rivals, it can afford to
     offer lower priced air tickets to its customers and
     make a profit. Low airfares have been so attractive to

        Another common mistake is to assume that steep
 demand curves are always inelastic and demand curves
 that have a shallow slope are always elastic. In Figure
     3, two demand curves are drawn. In Figure 3(a), the
     demand curve has a very shallow slope. The part that is
     drawn is elastic but this is only because it is just the top
     half of the line which is drawn. If the whole line were
     drawn, the bottom half would be inelastic even though
 the slope of the line is shallow. Similarly, in Figure 3(b),
 the demand curve has a very steep slope. The part
 that is shown is indeed price inelastic but this is only                       fo}                         Quantity

     A   Figure 6 Global crude oil demand, 1965-2015

     The demand for crude oil has increased steadily each year. In 2014, the average daily demand was 36
     million barrels per day higher than it was in 1986. During those 28 years, demand only dipped slightly three
     times but quickly recovered to maintain the historical growth rate.

Food and drink manufacturers are fighting fiercely
against measures that would restrict sales of their
foods. The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg,
announced a ban 10 days ago on the sale of
‘supersized’ sugary drinks in restaurants, cinemas and
stadiums. Hungary, France and Denmark have imposed
higher taxes on unhealthy foods in order to discourage
demand. In Denmark, for example, its ‘fat tax’ of
DKK16      (Danish krone) (US$2.88) per kilogram of
unhealthy saturated fat in a product will increase the
price of a burger by about US$0.18 and a small pack
of butter by about US$0.40.

THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

    ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION
    CONTINUES TO FALL
    In the USA in 2016, electricity sales fell for the sixth
    time in 10 years. Despite rising incomes and falling
    real prices, America's electricity users managed to
    do with less. Industrial firms made the sharpest cuts
    in their electricity usage. Their consumption fell in
    seven of the previous 10 years.
          The 1.3 per cent drop in total consumption in
    2016       looks small but it came despite real economic
    growth and the lower real price of electricity. In the
    past, electric sales always used to go up when the
    price of electricity declined and the economy grew.

 DECILE GROUPS
 A population can be split into 10 equal groups. These
 are called decile groups. In Table 7, on the next page,
 the groups are households, which are split according
 to their gross income. So the first decile group is the
 one-tenth of households that have the lowest income.                                   3

 GROSS AND DISPOSABLE INCOME
 Gross income is income before income tax, national
 insurance contributions and welfare benefits have been
 taken into account.
      Disposable income is equal to gross income
 minus income tax and employees’ national insurance
 contributions plus welfare benefits.

that an increase in incomes, all other things being

along the supply curve.

many manufacturers introduced flat screen televisions.
As a result, there was huge increase in sales of these
televisions and a dramatic fall in sales of older, more
bulky sets. In economic terms, the demand for older,

     THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

     THE PRICE OF GAS
     The world price of gas has a direct impact on
     households in the UK. The higher the price, the higher
     the gas bills for households tend to be.
        Most gas is sold on long-term contracts. A gas
     producer, like Shell or ExxonMobil, will enter into, say,
     a 10-year or 20-year deal to sell a customer gas at a
     particular price. A relatively small percentage of gas is
     sold in the ‘spot market’. This is the market for sales
     of gas in the very short term.
        The long-term trend has been for demand for gas
     to grow as Figure 7 shows. Fast growing emerging
     countries like China are demanding gas to fuel their
     economies. In developed countries, gas is being
     substituted for coal to produce electricity. Gas is a
     cleaner fuel than coal and produces fewer greenhouse
     gas emissions. The supply of gas has been growing
     too, particularly from Middle East producers, such as
     Saudi Arabia.
       The high cost of developing gas fields and
     transporting gas has tended to push up world gas
     spot prices over time, as Figure 8 shows. However,
     gas prices in the USA have fallen on average over the
     past few years because of fracking. This is a relatively
     new technology that involves pushing water at high
     pressure into gas bearing rocks and collecting the gas
     released.
        If there were no costs involved in the transportation
     of gas, gas prices in different parts of the world
     would be the same, assuming that other variables
     remained the same. However, in the USA,
     transportation infrastructure has not kept up with
     growth in gas production. There are not enough pipes
     or plants to convert gas into a liquid for transportation
     by ship to get more gas onto world markets. The gas
     therefore has to be sold relatively locally in the USA.
     This has increased supply relative to demand, pushing
     down gas prices in the USA at a time when gas
     prices in other markets, such as Japan and Europe,
     have been rising.
       Although global consumption of gas has increased
     slightly since 2014, the rate of increase has declined
     compared to the long-term average. The biggest
     increase in consumption has come from the EU and
     China, but in Brazil and Russia consumption has fallen as
     the use of renewable energy has increased. At the same
     time, supply has increased, particularly from Australia.
                                                                                   lM Europe & Asia         If Rest of world

 EXAM PRACTICE
COCOA BEAN PRICES
           LE           Se COMMUNICATION,


The raw ingredient for the chocolate we buy in stores
is cocoa beans. The world’s largest producer of beans
is the Ivory Coast in Africa, although the cocoa tree is
native to Central and South America.
  Cocoa is a commodity, and like other commodities
its price is subject to variation. Cocoa beans can be
stored from year to year. Rising prices will encourage
those holding stocks to sell into the market. Rising
prices will also encourage farmers to plant more cocoa
trees but these take four to five years to grow before
they will produce their first harvest. When prices fall
the reverse happens. In the short term, supply is
therefore very dependent on weather conditions.
  After a dip in 2012, cocoa prices rose steadily,
driven in part by rapidly rising demand in emerging
markets, such as China and India. Between 2009 and
2014, sales in India more than doubled from 54,700
tonnes to 129,200 tonnes, while China's rose 41 per
cent to 192,500 tonnes.
  In 2016, a surge in cocoa prices, caused chocolate
makers to use less cocoa, while the rising health
consciousness among consumers has led to declining
chocolate demand. On the supply side, bumper crops
from the lvory Coast and Ghana pushed cocoa prices
even lower. In early 2017, cocoa prices fell to a
10-year low.

 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIS

 MOTOR CARS
     The history of the UK motor car industry in recent
     years is a good example of how markets allocate
     resources. In the 1950s and 1960s, the British market
     was largely protected from foreign competition. The
     British motorist bought cars made in British factories,
     even if some of these factories were owned by foreign
     companies, such as Ford. It was largely a sellers’
     market, with demand restricted by the ability of
     consumers to obtain credit for the purchase of cars.
       The 1970s and 1980s, however, were disastrous
     for the British car industry. British-made cars tended
     to be of inferior quality in both production and
     design to foreign made, imported cars. High costs of
     production, due to high wages, a lack of investment

     THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIS

     THE FRENCH FILM INDUSTRY
     The French government has, for a long
     time, believed that its film industry
     should be protected. It believed that
     without aid the French film industry
     would die, overwhelmed by US imports
     of English-language films. Protecting
     the survival of the French film industry
     has mainly taken the form of a variety
     of subsidies to French film projects,

Markets do not always work or yield the anticipated results, sometimes not producing any
goods at all. This section looks at some of the reasons why this happens. It also looks at
the external impact that private actions can have on third parties in the form of positive and
negative externalities. Diagrams are introduced to show how marginal analysis can help identify
the optimum output and welfare loss and gain. The section ends with a look at how imperfect
information can arise, preventing rational decision making and leading to moral hazard,
speculation and market bubbles.

                                                            One example of this is in the provision of public goods.

MORAL HAZARD
Moral hazard is a term used to describe a situation in
which an individual or organisation is protected from
the consequences of their actions. They know that
someone else will have to deal with any problems that
occur. As a result, there is no incentive to take the
normal precautions and act sensibly, which may result
in unnecessary risk-taking and subsequent failure.              Cities across Southeast Asia have struggled to cope

   In contrast, the marginal benefit of consumption
of a product falls as consumption increases. Each
extra unit of consumption brings less benefit to the
consumer. The marginal benefit curve is the same
as the demand curve. This is because the demand
curve also shows the value of the benefit put on the
consumption of the product by a buyer.
   Assume that the marginal cost curve and marginal
benefit curve in Figure 1 are the costs and benefits to
society. Then welfare would be maximised at a quantity
level of OA and a price of OB. What if production and
consumption are not at OA?
   If quantity produced and consumed were greater
than OA, the extra cost of production would be
greater than the extra benefit from consumption.
Welfare would be improved by reducing production

CASE STUDY: POLLUTION IN CHINA

In 2014, media sources reported that tap water was cut off for the day in the Chinese city of Jingjiang. It
followed detection of an unknown pollutant in the city’s water supplies. Jingjiang, a city on the River Yangtze,
is a centre for shipbuilding and textiles, and it was thought that either industry could have been the source of
the pollution. Photos posted online showed residents filling buckets from an emergency water source in a local
public park.
   China invested US$536 billion in wastewater treatment and water cleaning plants during the five years to
2015, but one-quarter of its citizens still do not have access to clean drinking water.

The fight against malaria has had some success over
the past 15 years. Sources stated that deaths from
malaria fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2013
and occurrences of the disease have decreased by
one-quarter. In large part this is due to an increase
in international financial support for anti-malaria
efforts, from just US$100 million in 2000 to US$1.84
billion in 2012. An estimated 3.3 million lives have
been saved over the period. The hunt is still on for
a drug that will cure all malaria infections quickly, a
medicine that would permanently prevent infection or
an effective way of completely destroying the parasite
that causes malaria.
  However, in the meantime, a low-technology, low-
cost solution has contributed much to the reduction in
malarial infections. It is a sleeping net covered with

 GLOBAL CHILDHOOD OBESITY RISES TENFOLD IN 40 YEARS
               PROBLEM-SOLVING, REASONING,
               ANALYSIS



 The number of obese children and teenagers across
 the world has increased tenfold over the past 40 years
 and is about to overtake the number who are
 underweight, according to the most extensive analysis
 of body weight ever undertaken.
      The study, led by Imperial College London and the
 World Health Organization, used data on 31.5 million
 children and teenagers worldwide to estimate trends in
 body mass index (BMI) from 1975 to 2016. Over this
 period the number of obese girls, aged 5 to 19, rose
 from 5 million to 50 million, while the total for boys
 increased from 6 million to 74 million.

researchers point out that 75 million girls and
117 million boys are still moderately or severely
underweight. Two-thirds of these children who do not
receive enough food are in south Asia and especially
in India. In south Asia, 20.3 per cent of girls and

Many other goods, such as education and health,
contain a small public good element.


THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM
If the provision of public goods were left to the market
mechanism, there would be market failure. This is
because of the free rider problem. A public good
is one where it is impossible to prevent people from
receiving the benefits of the good once it has been
provided. So there is very little incentive for people to
pay for consumption of the good.
  A free rider is someone who receives the benefit
but allows others to pay for it. For instance, citizens
receive benefits from defence expenditure. But
individual citizens could increase their economic
welfare by not paying for it.
     In a free market, national defence is unlikely to
be provided. A firm attempting to provide defence
services would have difficulty charging for the product
since it could not be sold to benefit individual citizens.

The result would be that no one would pay for defence
and therefore the market would not provide it. The only      THE WORLD'S HUNGER FOR

      comparable — the rarer and, to a lesser
      extent, the more beautiful, the more you
      would pay. The maximum price reliably
      recorded for a tulip bulb during the mania
  was 5200 guilders (the Dutch currency

 INTERVENTION
Bin iA v
 When market failure occurs, the government intervenes to correct it with a range of policies and
 methods, including financial measures, legislation, regulation and the direct provision of goods
 and services. The areas where the government intervenes are considered; these include social
 contexts, such as housing and education, and areas of infrastructure, such as transport and
 energy. The concluding part examines the causes of government failure. This occurs because
 government intervention does not always work and may result in making the problem worse or
 lead to other unintended consequences.

MEASURES
OF ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE
  La a nT
This first section in Unit 2 looks at measures of economic performance. These are economic
growth, inflation, the balance of payments and employment/unemployment. The unit explains
how each of these performance measures are defined and calculated, and how to interpret
this data. The section discusses in depth using national income to compare living standards
over time, and between countries. It explores the concept of well-being and how this might be
measured. This section also looks at the causes and effects of inflation and unemployment.

THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

THE IRISH ECONOMY
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Ireland was nicknamed a ‘tiger economy’. The rate of growth of GDP averaged
4-5 per cent and unemployment was low. By 2007, income per head in Ireland was higher than in the UK.
That all changed in 2008.
     High economic growth in the Irish economy had been funded by a booming property market. Irish banks
had lent carelessly to property developers, builders and households. The worldwide financial crash of 2008 led
to the failure of the two main Irish banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, as well as a number of smaller
banks. They were rescued by the Irish government at a cost of €62.8 billion.
     The crisis had a direct impact on lIreland’s main economic indicators, as Figures 2 and 3 show. The economy
shrank in size, led by the construction industry. Unemployment increased dramatically. It would have been even
worse had many younger Irish workers not gone overseas to work. Prices fell due to lack of demand for goods
and services. The current account on the balance of payments improved because falling incomes hit the ability
of households and firms to spend on imports. In 2014, the economy showed signs that a long-term recovery
was taking place, six years after the disastrous events of 2008. In fact, in 2015 economic growth surged to
26.3 per cent after foreign companies, who had moved their base to Ireland, were included. In 2016 economic
growth had fallen to 4.3 per cent, with forecasts of 3.2 per cent for 2017 and 2.3 per cent for 2018. Although
the economic growth rate had fallen lower than its 2014 rate, output is still growing in Ireland. However, the

  THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

  INDICATORS OF NATIONAL HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING
  Comparing happiness and well-being between countries is hard, but attempts are made. The results are
  often interesting, since countries rankings will often come out very differently to those based only on real
  GDP per capita.

  The World Happiness Report
  In 2011, the UN General Assembly invited member
  countries to measure the happiness of their citizens
  and to use this to help guide their public policies.
  The first World Happiness Report was published in
      2012, in support of the UN High Level Meeting on
  happiness and well-being.
         The World Happiness Report is a survey of global
  happiness and, in 2017, ranked 155 countries by
  their happiness levels. This ranking is done by asking
  a sample of individuals (Gallup World poll), in the
  different countries, to evaluate their life and rate it on
  a scale of O-10 (subjective happiness). In general,
  research has found six key factors (indicators) that
  affect happiness levels reported between countries.
  These are real GDP per capita(PPP), health life expectancy at birth (the average years of healthy life that
  a person may expect to have), freedom to make choices about your life, social support (having a friend or
      relative you can rely on), trust in government, and generosity. Analysts will look at these indicators within each
  country and work out how much each of them contribute to the happiness levels reported.
         The findings are interesting. In 2007, the USA was third out of the OECD members in a happiness survey.
      However, in the 2017 report, which took the average of 2014—16 happiness scores, it had fallen to 14th
      place. Despite real GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy at birth rising, happiness levels were falling.
  What was pushing happiness levels down was a decline in the other key indicators. The USA showed less:
  social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations to charity and more perceived corruption of
  government and business. In contrast, Costa Rica stands out as being 12th in the rankings, despite having a
      much lower GDP per capita than most in the top 20.
         GDP per capita among the top 10 were 25 times higher than in the bottom 10. Income differences were
  found to be more than one-third of the total explanation for differences in happiness levels between countries.
      However, this also means that there are other important factors that affect happiness and well-being. Reports
  such as these highlight to policy makers that there is not a clear link between economic growth and happiness.

    EXAM TIP

    Begin by explaining what GDP per capita, at PPP, means and why it provides a useful starting point for
    comparing living standards. Expand by discussing what well-being means and why a range of indicators are
    useful to measure this. Think about why higher income countries are likely to have higher well-being for some
    of these indicators. Evaluate by discussing why some countries may have high GDP per capita, at PPP, but low
    well-being overall. However, why are some rankings, which use a broad range of well-being measures, often
    criticised?

 ACTIVITY 2 [f skits Serial
 CASE STUDY: US MANUFACTURING JOBS

 Between 2000 and 2010, 5.6 million manufacturing jobs were lost in the USA. Many believe international trade
 is to blame, as cheap imports threaten US manufacturing jobs. However, according to a study by the Center
 for Business and Economic Research Ball State University, 85 per cent of these job losses are largely caused
 by automation. Although many low-skilled jobs have been lost, productivity has increased and manufacturing
 output has grown.

 (a) Explain why the use of technology might benefit manufacturing firms in the USA.
 (b) To what extent will workers, who have lost their jobs through automation, remain unemployed?

      of national income. An increase in wages will have
      a significant impact on costs of production.
  e   Imports can cause a rise in price. A boom in                                                              AD

exports, would have to have an effect that was greater

deflation is more likely if there is a significant negative
output gap (there is significant unused productive
potential in the economy so the economy is operating
below full employment). In the same way, a fall in oil
prices would have to be very significant to offset the
other cost rises that normally occur in the economy, for
example, positive wage growth, for deflation to occur.

Understanding what affects total spending in an economy is crucial for economists and
policymakers. The section starts by introducing aggregate demand and its components. It
explains the concept of the aggregate demand curve and why the aggregate demand curve
may shift. It fully explores factors that influence consumer spending, investment, government
spending and the net trade balance. Such factors include confidence, interest rates, availability
of credit, disposable income and the exchange rate.

   OF AGGREGATE DEMAND
    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
 @ Know that the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping. It shows the relationship between the price level
      and equilibrium output in the economy.
 TM@ Understand that a movement along the aggregate demand curve shows how real output will change if there is a
      change in the price level.
 TM@ Understand that a shift in the aggregate demand curve is caused by a change in variables, such as consumption
      and exports at any given price level.

need to think about what affects the fraction of total disposable income which is saved. Why might the age
distribution of a population affect savings? What other factors also affect the savings ratio between economies
and over time? Use the ‘Thinking like an economist’ section to help you. To evaluate, consider whether the age
distribution differences between economies, and over time, would be sufficient to explain the differences in the
savings ratio.

A DEFINITION OF INVESTMENT
Economists use the word investment in a very precise
way. Investment is the addition to the capital stock of
the economy — factories, machines, offices and stocks
of materials used to produce other goods and services.
       In everyday language, ‘investment’ and ‘saving’
are often used to mean the same thing. For instance,
we talk about ‘investing in the building society’ or
‘investing in shares’. For an economist, these two
would be examples of saving. For an economist,
investment only takes place if real products are
created. To give two more examples:
       putting money into a bank account would be
       saving; the bank buying a computer to handle your
       account would be investment
       buying shares in a new company would be saving;
       buying new machinery to set up a company would
       be investment.                                           Using the photograph showing the interior of a bank,

      INVESTMENT IN ITALY
      In 2014, Janssen, a medium-sized
      pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Italy,
      invested €500,000 in a machine capable
      of producing up to 70,000 capsules per

      could only produce 17,000 capsules per

Extract B

        In October 2015, total capital expenditure had
        dropped dramatically and was set to hit its lowest
        level since 2010. Mr Modi, India’s prime minister
        elected in 2014, had made encouraging the private
        sector to invest again one of his key objectives.
           In October 2015, the central bank governor cut
        interest rates by 0.5 per cent in a bid to increase
        business investment. It is thought that high interest
        rates in India have played a part in causing weak
        levels of investment. However, this may not increase

The business confidence index (BCI) is based on
enterprises’ assessment of production, orders and
stocks, as well as its current position and expectations
for the immediate future. Opinions compared to a
‘normal’ state are collected and the difference between
positive and negative answers provides a qualitative
index on economic conditions.

  4 Japan’s net trade balance
      Extract A
       According to the Bank of Japan 2017, Japan's exports have picked up recently, as overseas economies have continued
       to grow at a moderate rate. The rise in exports has mainly been led by automobile-related exports to advanced economies
       and IT related exports to emerging economies in Asia. Exports are likely to continue their upward trend. It is expected that
       advanced economies, such as the US and European economies, will continue to grow steadily and the recovery in emerging
       economies will take hold.
             The election of Donald Trump in the USA, in November 2016, also caused the yen to weaken sharply against
       the dollar. A US dollar exchanged for 100-105 Japanese yen before the election, and afterwards, a US dollar exchanged
       for    110-115 Japanese yen. This has helped to boost export competitiveness. Provided the yen remains weak and
       Mr Trump's trade polices do not cause a rise in protectionism, export growth should remain strong for Japan.

 HINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

INCREASING GOVERNMENT SPENDING
The global financial crisis caused recessions in many countries,
including the USA and UK. In the USA in 2009, President Barack
Obama launched a stimulus plan, worth almost 6 per cent of
GDP. Taxes for businesses were cut and government spending on
health, education, social security and infrastructure rose. Money
was injected into the circular flow to increase national output,
income and expenditure. Between 2010 and 2012, the USA
was reporting growth figures consistently higher than the UK.
   In contrast, although the UK government had increased some
government spending and reduced the rate of VAT in 2009,
the stimulus was less significant. By 2010, the new coalition
government decided the priority was to reduce the budget deficit
(the difference between government spending and taxation). The
government raised taxes and reduced government spending. The
circular flow model shows that this will shrink the size of income,
output and expenditure flowing round the economy. Critics argue
that this policy was a mistake and explains why UK growth
between 2010 and 2013 was weak compared to that of the
USA. The UK economy only expanded slightly in this period due
to small increases in investment and exports. Some argue that a
better policy would have been for the government to increase its
spending on investment goods, because this type of spending

EXAM HINT

A ‘discuss’ question requires knowledge, application,
analysis and evaluation. Explain how aggregate
demand is affected for each of the shocks. Link this
with the data given in Figures 15 and 16. Make sure
you use a short-run AD/AS diagrams to illustrate the
effects on the price level and real output in South
Korea. For the evaluation, consider to what extent
South Korea might be affected — use the extract to
support your answer.

  THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

      IMF AND OECD ENCOURAGES
      INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE
      European countries, including the UK, face major
      infrastructure problems. In the UK, for example, a
      lack of investment in new or upgraded road and
      rail links is increasing journey times and transport
      costs for firms. A failure to invest sufficiently in new
      housing is one cause of house price inflation. In
      Europe, transport links too are a major problem. The
      German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin)
      estimated that Germany spent 40 per cent less on
      transport infrastructure between 2006 and 2011
      than needed to maintain the existing system in good
      working order. The fall in investment can be seen
      in Figure 3. Extra investment of €10 billion a year
      would be needed to make up the shortage. Energy
      is another area suffering from lack of investment. In
      the UK, a failure to invest in new electricity sources
      such as gas-fired power stations or renewable
      energies means that the margin needed to prevent
      loss of power in some areas at peak demand times in
      winter is now dangerously small. In Europe, building
      new power lines between countries could reduce
      electricity costs for consumers and firms. Spain and

 a better-educated workforce, shown by ‘Labour

 contribution to economic growth. For the most
 part, so too has the number of hours worked. On
 the whole, this has not come from individual full-
 time employees working longer hours. It has come
 from an expanding labour force particularly due to
 immigration from the EU, and from part-time workers
 increasing their hours perhaps to full time.

THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST

AFRICA — HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
The year 2016 was one of mixed performances
in economic growth across the African continent.
Nigeria and South Africa, which account for half
of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP, were at or close to
recession. Other resource-rich countries, including
Angola, Mozambique and Zambia, suffered low
growth as commodity prices fell. This reduced
export-led growth in these economies. Growth in the
region overall is forecast to be 3 per cent.
   However, Kenya enjoyed relative success. In
2016, Kenya was one of the best performing
economies in sub-Saharan Africa. The government
expects growth to increase from 5.6 per cent in
2015   to 6.1 per cent in 2016. Some of the key
drivers for Kenya's growth include low fuel prices, a
growing middle class and rising incomes, which will
increase consumption, as well as increased public
investment in energy and transport.
   Despite this, Mr Njoroge, the Kenyan Central Bank
governor, has some worries. In 2016, he said he was
particularly concerned about the effect the UK leaving
the EU (Brexit) would have on Kenyan exports. The
EU, and especially the UK, has been a big market
for Kenyan flowers and vegetables. Addressing
challenges of low investment and low productivity will
also be vital to achieve sustained economic growth
for Kenya.
   There is some optimism for the long-term
prospects of African economies. The McKinsey

 of households, compared to the bottom 40 per
 cent, was nearly 10. By 2014, this had fallen to
 approximately 6.
   However, as with any economy, there are still those
 who do not benefit significantly. Income support for
 disadvantaged persons such as the unemployed,
 single parents, disabled and elderly, is poorly
 targeted. Support is also inadequate to ensure basic
 living standards. Government expenditure on social
 protection is still lower than in all Southeast Asian
 countries, for which data is available.
     There are also large differences in GDP per capita
 per region. In 2014, Kelantan had the lowest GDP per
 capita at MYR 11,820, with Kuala Lumpur the highest
 at MYR 91,100. The income gap between the richer
 and poorer states has widened over the last five years.
 However, steps have been taken to improve access
 to quality healthcare for low income urban and rural
 residents. The 11th Malaysia Plan includes objectives
 to extend the provision of rural basic infrastructure,
 including road, water and energy supply.

Macroeconomic objectives, introduced in the first section, are developed further. This section
explains why policymakers will find it hard to achieve all these objectives at any one time and
explores the conflicts between macroeconomic objectives. The section finishes by looking at a
range of demand and supply-side polices, which are used by governments and central banks
to help improve the performance of an economy. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of       me
different polices.

rate of inflation is too high. One way to reduce the
rate of inflation is to reduce aggregate demand, for
example, by cutting consumer spending or government
spending. However, reducing aggregate demand is
likely to lead to recession and cyclical unemployment.

CASE STUDY: HOW FLEXIBLE SHOULD WAGES BE?

Further cuts in real wages in countries whose labour markets have been hardest hit by the economic crisis would
risk creating deflation and deepening poverty, the OECD has warned. It said that reforms to increase competition
in product and service markets, rather than more wage adjustments, were needed. The priority now was to
foster the creation of not just more jobs but also better jobs. Wage adjustment had played an important part in
helping labour markets weather the deep downturn by improving competitiveness and reducing job losses. Any
further reduction of wages risks being counter-productive, because economies would run into a vicious circle of
deflation, lower consumption and lower investment. Policies such as minimum wages, progressive taxation and
in-work benefits could help to share the costs of economic adjustments more fairly

ECONOMIC DATA: REFERENCE SHEET
Key points

     1. Economic data is collected not only to verify or refute economic models but to provide a basis for
        economic decision making.
     2. Data may be expressed at nominal (or current) prices or at real (or constant) prices. Data ex
        pressed in real terms takes into account the effects of inflation.
     3. Indices are used to simplify statistics and to express averages.
     4. Data can be presented in a variety of forms such as tables or graphs.
     5. All data should be interpreted with care given that data can be selected and presented in a wide
         variety of ways.


The collection and reliability of data

Economists collect data for two main reasons.
    * The scientific method requires that theories be tested. Data may be used to refute or support a theory.
      For instance, an economist might gather data to support or refute the hypothesis that ‘cuts in the
      marginal rate of income tax will increase the incentive to work’, or that ‘an increase in the real value of
      unemployment benefit will lead to an increase in the number of people unemployed’.
      Economists are often required to provide support for particular policies. Without economic data it is of-
      ten difficult, if not impossible, to make policy recommendations. For instance, in his Budget each year,
      the Chancellor of the Exchequer has to make a statement to the House of Commons outlining the
      state of the economy and the economic outlook for the next 12 months. Without a clear knowledge
      of where the economy is at the moment, it is impossible to forecast how it might change in the future
      and to recommend policy changes to steer the economy in a more desirable direction.


Collecting economic data is usually very difficult and sometimes impossible. Some macroeconomic data —
such as the balance of payments figures or the value of national income — is collected from a wide variety
of sources. The figures for the balance of payments on current account are compiled from returns made
by every exporter and importer on every item exported and imported. Not surprisingly, the information is
inaccurate. Some exporters and importers will conceal transactions to avoid tax. Others will not want to be
bothered with the paperwork.


Other macroeconomic data such as the Consumer Prices Index (used to measure inflation) or the Labour
Force Survey (used to measure employment and unemployment) are based on surveys. Surveys are only
reliable if there is accurate sampling and measuring and are rarely as accurate as a complete count.
Some macroeconomic data is very reliable statistically but does not necessarily provide a good measure
of the relevant economic variable. In the UK, the unemployment claimant count is calculated each month at
benefit offices throughout the country. It is extremely accurate, but no economist would argue that the figure
produced is an accurate measure of unemployment. There is general agreement that some people who
claim benefit for being unemployed are not unemployed and conversely there are many unemployed people
who are not claiming benefit.


In microeconomics use is again made of survey data, with the limitations that this implies. Economists also
make use of more experimental data, gathering evidence for case studies. For instance, economists might
want to look at the impact of different pricing policies on entry to sports centres. They might study a small
 QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH                                                                                            333


number of sports centres in a local area. The evidence gathered would be unlikely decisively to refute or
support a general hypothesis such as ‘cheap entry increases sports centre use’. But it would be possible to
conclude that the evidence tended to support or refute the hypothesis.


In economics it is difficult to gather accurate data and, for that reason, academic economists mostly qualify
their conclusions.


Real and nominal values
There are many different measures in use today such as tonnes, litres, kilograms and kilometres. Often, we
want to be able to compare these different measures. For instance, an industrialist might wish to compare
oil measured in litres, and coal measured in kilograms. One way of doing this is to convert oil and coal into
therms, using gross calorific values. In economics, by far the most important measure used is the value of
an item measured in monetary terms, such as pounds sterling, US dollars or euros. One problem in using
money as a measure is that inflation (the general change in prices in an economy) erodes the purchasing
power of money.


For instance, in 1948 the value of output of the UK economy (measured by gross domestic product at
market prices) was £11.6 billion. In 2013, 65 years later, it was £1 713.3 billion. It would seem that output
had increased about 148 times (£1713.3 billion + £11.6 billion) — an enormous increase. In fact, output
increased by only a fraction of that amount. This is because most of the measured increase was an increase
not in output but in prices. Prices over the period rose about 29-fold. Stripping the inflation element out of
the increase leaves us with an increase in output of 5.2 times.


Values unadjusted for inflation are called nominal values. These values are expressed at current prices (i.e.
at the level of prices existing during the time period being measured). If data is adjusted for inflation, then
they are said to be at real values or at constant prices. To do this in practice involves taking one period of
time as the base period. Data are then adjusted assuming that prices were the same throughout as in the
base period.


For instance, a basket of goods costs £100 in Year 1 and £200 in Year 10. Prices have therefore doubled.
If you had £1000 to spend in Year 10, then that would have been equivalent to £500 at Year 1 prices
because both amounts would have bought five baskets of goods. On the other hand, if you had £1000 to
spend in Year 1, that would be equivalent to £2000 in Year 10 prices because both would have bought you
10 baskets of goods.


Taking another example, the real value of UK output in 1948 at 1948 prices was the same as its nominal
value (i.e. £11.6 billion). The real value of output in 2013 at 1948 prices was £57.8 billion. It is much
lower than the nominal 2013 value because prices were much higher in 2013. On the other hand, at 2013
prices, the real value of output in 1948 was £320.2 billion, much higher than the nominal value because
prices in 2013 were much higher than in 1948. Further examples are given in Table 1. UK government
statistics expressed in real terms are adjusted to prices three or four years previously. In 2018, figures were
expressed at 2015    prices.

      worth £200 + 1.2 in Year 1 prices.


      Indices
      It is often more important in economics to compare values than to know absolute values. For instance, we
      might want to compare the real value of output in the economy in 2003 and 2013. Knowing that the real
      value of output (GDP at market prices at 2013 prices) in 2003 was £1471.1 billion and in 2013 was
      £1656.5 billion is helpful, but the very large numbers make it difficult to see at a glance what, for instance,
      was the approximate percentage increase. Equally, many series of statistics are averages. The Retail Prices
      Index (the measure of the cost of living) is calculated by working out what it would cost to buy a typical
      cross-section or ‘basket’ of goods. Comparing, say, £458.92 in one month with £475.13 the next is not
      easy.



      So, many series are converted into index number form. One time period is chosen as the base period and
      the rest of the statistics in the series are compared to the value in that base period. The value in the base
      period is usually 100. The figure 100 is chosen because it is easy to work with mathematically.
      Taking the example of output again, if 1948 were taken as the base year, then the value of real output in
      1948 would be 100, and the value of real output in 2013 would be 517.3. Alternatively, if 2013 were
      taken as the base year, the value of output would be 100 in 2013 and 19.3 in 1948. Or with 2003 as the
      base year, the value of output in 1948 would be 21.8 whilst in 2013 it would be 112.6. Further examples
      are given in Table 2.

      Note: The index number for consumption in Year 2, if Year 1 is the base year, is (600 + 500) x 100.

      The interpretation of data
      Data can be presented in many forms and be used both to inform and mislead the reader. To illustrate these
      points, consider inflation figures for the UK economy. Inflation is the general rise in prices in an economy. If
      there has been 2 per cent inflation over the past year, it means that prices on average have increased by 2
      per cent. One way in which inflation figures can be presented is in tabular form as in Table 3. The data could
      also be presented in graphical form as in Figure 1 (a).

UK Inflation (CPI)                           Graphs must be interpreted with some care. Figure 1 (b) gives a distorted
                                             view of inflation between 2001 and 2003. Figure 1 (a) shows that there
                                             was almost no change in inflation over these three years. But looking at
                                             Figure 1 (b), it would seem that there has been a massive change in infla-
                                             tion. This is because in Figure 1(b) the vertical scale starts at 1.20 per
                                             cent and ends at 1.40 per cent and on the horizontal scale, only three
                                             years are covered. Figure 1(c) distorts the data in a different way.
                                             By compressing the scale on the vertical axis in relation to the horizon-
                                             tal axis, it looks as though there has been hardly any change in inflation
                                             between 1990 and 2013. Graphs are sometimes constructed using log
                                             scales for the vertical axis. This has the effect of gradually compress-
                                             ing values on the vertical axis as they increase. The vertical distance
                                             between O and 1, for instance, is larger per unit than between 999 and
                                             1000.
                                             Data can also be expressed in verbal form. For example, Figure 1 (a)
                                             shows that inflation was lower at 2.6 per cent at the end of the period in
                                             2013      than at the start in 1990 when it was 7 per cent. Over the period
                                             1990-2013, inflation ranged from a high of 7.5 per cent in 1991 toa
                                             low of 0.8 per cent in 2000. When expressing data in verbal form, it can
                                             become very tedious to describe each individual change. For instance,
                                             it would be inappropriate to say, ‘Inflation in 1990 was seven per cent.
                                             Then it rose to 7.5 per cent in 1991 before falling to 4.2 per cent in
                                             1992. Then in 1993 it fell again to 2.5 per cent and again in 1994 to
                                             2.0 per cent.’ When expressing data in verbal form, it is important to pick
                                             out the main trends and perhaps give a few key figures to illustrate these
                                             trends.

      ECONOMIC DATA: WORKSHEET
      Question 1
      How do you double the size of your economy overnight to become the largest economy in Africa? The
      answer is to revise your estimate of the output of the economy, called GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This
      is what Nigeria has done. It was reported that it announced its GDP for 2013 as $509 billion, 89 per cent
      larger than previously stated. Previous estimates were based on a way of calculating GDP set in 1990 that
      failed to capture many of Nigeria’s growth industries. For example, under the old method, telecoms includ-
      ing mobiles accounted for 0.8 per cent of GDP. Under the new method, it is 8.6 per cent of GDP. Under the
      old method, the film industry was not even measured. Under the new method, it accounts for 1.4 per cent
      of GDP.

      ECONOMIC DATA: WORKSHEET ANSWERS
      Question 1

      (a) Explain why the estimates of GDP in 2013 using the 1990 method of calculation were unreliable.


      GDP is a measure of the national income of an economy. Between 1990 and 2013, the Nigerian economy
      grew in size. However, the 1990 method of calculation failed to capture part of that growth. For example,
      by 2013, it significantly underestimated the size of both the telecoms industry and the film industry. Under
      the 1990 measure, the film industry was ‘not even measured’, i.e. it was given a value of zero per cent.
      However, under the new 2013      estimate, it was measured as 1.4 per cent of GDP. With telecoms, includ-
      ing mobile phones, the 1990 measure calculated that the industry accounted for 0.8 per cent of GDP. The
      2013     estimate suggested it was actually 8.6 per cent of GDP. Hence, the 1990 measure underestimated
      the actual size of the economy in 2013 and was therefore an unreliable measure in 2013.


      (b) Suggest why a European company might be more prepared to invest in new facilities in Nigeria rather
      than South Africa in 2014 compared to 2012.


      A European company investing in new facilities in Nigeria is likely to be attracted either by low costs of pro-
      duction or access to the domestic market for the goods or services produced, or some combination of both.
      A larger economy will not necessarily have low costs of production for its firms. However, the larger the
      economy, the larger the potential domestic market is likely to be and hence the larger the likely sales from a
      production facility. By adjusting its GDP figures by 89 per cent for 2013, the Nigerian government has sig-
      nalled to potential investors that the size of the domestic economy is much larger than previously estimated.
      Hence, it is likely to be more attractive to outside investors, such as a European company. Using the 1990
      method, the South African economy was larger than the Nigerian economy in 2013. Hence, this would give
      the South African economy a competitive advantage in attracting inward investment from European com-
      panies looking to sell into the domestic market. However, using the 2013 method, the Nigerian economy
      is significantly larger than the South African economy. Hence, Nigeria is more attractive on potential sales
      criteria than South Africa. The value of potential sales is only one of many factors that will influence a Eu-
      ropean firm's investment decisions. Firms may have already estimated that Nigeria’s GDP was considerably
      larger than official 1990 figures suggested. However, all other things being equal, the upward revaluation of
      Nigeria’s GDP figures is likely to make Nigeria a more attractive country in which to invest.


      Question 2
      Using a calculator or a spreadsheet, work out for the period 2010-13, (a) at constant 2010 prices and (b)
      at constant 2013   prices, the values of:
       i) households’ expenditure
           government expenditure
             fixed investment.
      Present your calculations in the form of two tables, one for 2010 prices and the other for 2013      prices.


      To calculate the values, the expenditure at current prices needs to be adjusted for changes in the index of
      prices. For example, to calculate fixed investment at 2010   prices for 2011, it is necessary to multiply the
      2011 at current prices by the ratio of prices in 2010 to 2011.
      So, the calculation is £260.8 billion x (100.0 + 104.5) which is £249.6 billion to one decimal place.

340    QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH


      To calculate the index values, expenditure at current prices needs to be compared to the value in a base
      period. For example, to calculate food & drink in 2011 using 2010 as a base year, the 2011 number must
      be divided by the 2010 number and then multiplied by 100 to convert the ratio into index number form. So,
      it is (86.4 + 82.8) x 100, which is 104.3 to one decimal place.

      Question 4
      Consider each graph in turn.
      (a) What does each show?
      Both graphs show the unemployment rate over a period of time. Figure 2 gives annual data and shows that
      over the whole period 1971 to 2013, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Within
      this period, there were five identifiable peaks in 1972, 1977, 1984, 1993 and 2011, reflecting the cyclical
      nature of unemployment. The highest level of unemployment was experienced in 1984 when unemployed
      reached 11.8 per cent. Figure 3 shows quarterly unemployment rates for 2010 and 2011. Over the whole
      period, unemployment increased from 8.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2010 to 8.4 per cent in the last
      quarter of 2011, although within this unemployment at first fell before rising again.

      (b) Explain why each seems to give a different picture of unemployment in the UK for the period 2010—
      2011.
      Figure 2 shows annual data for unemployment over a long period of 43 years. As part of this, the increase
      in the annual unemployment rate between 2010 and 2011 was relatively small. The annual unemploy-
      ment rate in 2010 was 7.9 per cent compared to 8.1 per cent for 2011, a 0.2 per cent increase in total.
      Compared to other changes in unemployment over a two-year period, this was insignificant. For example,
      between 1980 and 1981, unemployment rose from 6.8 per cent to 9.6 per cent, a 2.8 per cent increase in
      total. It also shows that the increase in unemployment between 2010 and 2011 was the smaller part of a
      much larger increase in unemployment between 2007 and its peak in 2011.
      In contrast, Figure 3 shows quarterly data for a small period of just two years. The increase in the unem-
      ployment rate looks relatively large for three reasons. One is that the vertical axis starts at 7.6 per cent
      rather than O. Compressing the axis to accommodate the data makes changes seem much larger than if they
      were not compressed. Another is that the change occurs out of context of the period in which it occurs.
      Figure 3 shows that the rise was insignificant in the context of the wider period 1971-2013. Lastly, using
      quarterly data will tend to give much larger fluctuations than using yearly data. The range using yearly data
      for 2010-11 was 0.2 per cent. The range using quarterly data for the same period was 0.7 per cent — the
      difference between 8.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2011 and 7.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2010.
      Annual data ‘smooths out’ the larger fluctuations that can be found in quarterly data.

Section A
In Section A, you will be given six multiple-choice questions and you need to answer all of them. Even if you
are not sure of the answer to a question, you should always select an answer. No deductions will be made
for wrong answers. Each question is worth 1 mark. This section will be primarily focused on test assessment
objectives AO1 and AO2. This section will also provide an opportunity to test quantitative skills.

Command words

Questions in Section B, Section C and Section D will include the use of the following command words. The ta-
ble shows the list of command words along with the outline of what each type of question requires students
to do.


Command word           Number of marks | What students are required to do
 Define                2                     Requires knowledge and understanding only. Requires students to
                                            give the meaning of a term, concept or phrase.
Calculate              2or4                 Assesses quantitative skills. Requires a calculation involving sev-
                                            eral stages based on given data and may involve the use of a
                                             prescribed diagram or formula. Calculators may be used. Students
                                            are advised to show workings.
 Draw                  4                    Assesses quantitative skills. Requires students to con-struct an ac-
                                            curately labelled diagram, using quantita-tive skills. Students may
                                            be required to decide on a type of diagram, or the type required
                                             may be stated.

 Explain               4                    When asking students to explain a term or the charac-teristics, this
                                            requires knowledge, understanding and application.


                                            When asking students to explain a reason or impact, this also in-
                                            cludes analysis as it requires a two-stage chain of reasoning.
Analyse                6                     Requires knowledge, understanding, application and analysis.
                                             Requires an explanation which includes a chain of reasoning,

                                            evaluation. Requires an explanation which includes a chain of rea-
                                            soning, and diagrams where appropriate. Focuses on depth rather
                                            than breadth. Any relevant data provided needs to be in-terpreted.
                                            There should be a brief assessment of the arguments/factors/evi-

                                            developed with reference to context, where appropriate. The valid-
                                             ity and signifi-cance of arguments/models and concepts should be
                                            considered and supported by relevant chains of rea-soning. There
                                            should also be a recognition of different viewpoints and/or a criti-

                                               to be developed with reference to context, where appropriate.
                                               The validity and significance of arguments/models and concepts
                                               should be considered and supported by relevant chains of reason-
                                               ing. There should also be a recogni-tion of different viewpoints
                                               and/or a critical assess-ment of the evidence so that informed
                                               judgements may be made.



Section B
In Section B, there are five questions and you need to answer all of them. Each question may include a short
piece of information on the question topic. The types of questions that are likely to be included in this sec-
tion are:
    * ‘Draw’ questions are awarded 1 mark for ‘Knowledge’ and 3 marks for ‘Application’. Draw questions
      test Quantitative Skill 4 and Quantitative Skill 9;
    * ‘Explain’ questions which ask candidates to explain a term or characteristics are awarded 2 marks for
      ‘Knowledge’ marks and 2 marks for ‘Application’;
    * ‘Explain’ questions which ask candidates to explain a reason or impact are awarded 1 mark for ‘Knowl-
      edge’, 1 mark for ‘Application’ and 2 marks for ‘Analysis’; and
    * Calculate questions are awarded 1 mark for ‘Knowledge’ and 3 marks for ‘Application’. Calculation
      questions test Quantitative Skills, especially Quantitative Skill 1, Quantitative Skill 2, Quantitative Skill 3,
      Quantitative Skill 5, and Quantitative Skill 8.



Section C
In Section C, you will have to answer five questions (12a-12e) based on economics related source material.
The source material may include both data, graphical information and written extracts. You will be expected
to write an extended answer worth 14 marks in part e. This question will be marked using a level-based
mark scheme, with 8 marks available for Knowledge, Application and Analysis, and 6 marks available for
Evaluation.
The five-part question, based on data provided in the source booklet will be worth the following marks:
    (a) 2 marks — typically a ‘define’ question worth 2 ‘Knowledge’ marks
    (b) 4 marks — typically an ‘explain’ question with 2 ‘Knowledge’ marks and 2 ‘Application’ marks
    (c) 6 marks — typically an ‘analysis’ question with 2 ‘Knowledge’ marks, 2 ‘Application’ marks and 2
            ‘Analysis’ marks
    (d) 8 marks — typically an ‘examine’ question with 2 ‘Knowledge’ marks, 2 ‘Application’ marks, 2 ‘Analysis
          marks and 2 ‘Evaluation’ marks
    (e) 14 marks — typically a ‘discuss’ question which is awarded 8 marks for ‘Knowledge, Application and
          Analysis’ based on a level-based marking grid which has three levels; and 6 marks for ‘Evaluation’
    based
          on a level-based marking grid which has three levels.

  The level-based marking grids used in part (e) are given in the mark scheme in the International Advanced
  Level Economics Sample Assessment Materials on page 39:

                                               of the question. Some evidence and contextual references are
                                               evident in the answer.
                                               Chains of reasoning in terms of cause and/or consequence are
                                               evident but they may not be developed fully, or some stages are

  Section D
  In Section D, you will be given two essay questions and you need to pick one to answer.
  Each question may include a short piece of information on the question topic.
  This question will use the command words ‘Evaluate’ or ‘To what extent’. The essay will be worth 20 marks,
  which consists of 12 marks for ‘Knowledge, Application and Analysis’ and 8 marks for ‘Evaluation’.   The essay
  PREPARING FOR EXAMS


will be marked using a level-based marking grid.
Your response must demonstrate a logical and coherent multi-stage chain of reasoning, which needs to be
developed with reference to context, where appropriate. The validity and significance of arguments/models and
concepts should be considered and supported by relevant chains of reasoning. There should also be a
recognition of different viewpoints and/or a critical assessment of the evidence so that informed judgements/
arguments may be made.


  The level-based marking grid used in Section D is given in the mark scheme in the International Advanced
  Level Economics Sample Assessment Materials on pages 40 and 41:

  Skills required when answering questions
  One important element in your preparation for the Economics AS Level examination (Paper 1 and Paper 2) is
  to understand the skills required to be successful. You will need to demonstrate four different skills referred to
  as assessment objectives (AOs).



  AO1 — Knowledge. This means you must:
  Demonstrate knowledge of economic terminology, concepts, theories and models to show an understanding of
  the behaviour of economic agents (e.g. consumers, firms and governments) and how they are affected by and
  respond to economics issues (e.g. the introduction of a sugar tax).
  All questions will test knowledge to some extent.
  AO1 is worth 27.5% of the marks at International AS Level.



  AO2 - Application. This means that you must:
  Apply knowledge and understanding to various economic contexts to show how economic agents (consumers,
  firms and governments) are affected by, and respond, to economic issues. The context may, for example, be
  provided in a data response question or in the title of an essay.

  Examples of Application might include:
       *   using relevant concepts and theories to provide an answer that is focused on the question set
       *   presenting a valid, relevant diagram
       *   using numerical and statistical data that is related to the context, including your own calculations (e.g.
           stating that for a firm selling a product that has a PED of -2, a 10% fall in the price will lead to a 20%
           increase in the quantity demanded)
       *   using data taken from the extracts in a data response question
       *   Using your own knowledge of real-world events in a manner that is linked to the context of the question

      Most questions in the examination will require you to demonstrate application. This means that you must en-
  sure that your answers relate directly to the context given in the question.
  AO2 is worth 30% of the marks at International AS Level.



  AO3 - Analysis. This means you must:
  Analyse issues and evidence, showing an understanding of their impact on economic agents.
     PREPARING FOR EXAMS                                                                                                347


Examples of analysis might include:
 *     the construction of an argument using a logical chain of reasoning
 *     making use of a diagram to help construct a logical argument
 *     breaking down a complex problem into smaller elements to provide a clearer understanding of the prob-
       lem
 *     explaining relationships between different aspects of the problem
 *     using relevant economic concepts and principles in a logical fashion to make it easier to understand the
       key elements of a complex problem
 *     making inferences and drawing conclusions from numerical and/or statistical data
 *     presenting an answer that is well organised and has a clear, logical structure


All question worth 6 or more marks will include some marks for Analysis.       Explain question worth 4 marks
which ask the candidate to explain a reason or impact will included 2 marks for Analysis.


AO3 is worth 22.5% of the marks at International AS Level.



AO4 - Evaluation. This means that you must:
Evaluate by making reasoned judgements, by questioning your analysis and assessing different points of view.
You will need to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative evidence to make informed judgements relating to
economics issues.

Examples of evaluation might include:
 *     making judgements
 *     using a logical argument to support judgements
 *     supporting judgements using qualitative evidence
 *     supporting judgements using quantitative evidence
 *     assessing the strengths and limitations of the supporting evidence
 *     assessing the impact on different social groups or economic agents
 *     distinguishing between possible short-run and long-run effects
 *     showing an appreciation of the role of assumptions and the significance of relaxing or modifying the as-
       sumptions
 *     presenting both sides of an argument (or point of view)
 *     providing a critical appraisal of an argument (or point of view) that has been presented
 *     presenting and assessing the relative merits of alternative arguments (or points of view) before arriving at
       a conclusion
 *     presenting a conclusion which may be tentative or qualified
 *     where relevant, developing and proposing a solution to a problem
 *     consideration of the significance of other factors, influences or events that might affect the validity of any
       conclusions
 *     showing an appreciation of the role of value judgements when supporting conclusions


When evaluating, it is often possible to draw several different conclusions. Very often in economics there is no
‘right’ answer, so examiners are likely to be more interested in whether your judgment     is plausible and the qual-
ity of your argument in support of that judgment. Questions that carry eight marks or more will include some
marks for Evaluation.


AO4 is worth 30% of the marks at International AS Level.

      General advice
      You should familiarise yourself with the layout of the paper by looking at the sample assessment materi-
      als published by Edexcel. The questions within each section are followed by lined spaces where you should
      write your answer. Use the mark allocation as a guide to how much time to spend on each question.
