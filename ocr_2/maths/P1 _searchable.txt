     ® Surds
     If nis an integer that is not a square number, then any multiple of vi is called a surd.
     Examples of surds are y2, 19 and 5y2.

     Surds are examples of irrational numbers.           { Notation ) ee eee                    eee
     The decimal expansion of a surd is never-ending         fain $ where aand bare integers.
     and never repeats, for example v2 = 1414213562...

     You can use surds to write exact answers to calculations.

     ® You can manipulate surds using these rules:

    @® Rationalising denominators
     If a fraction has a surd in the denominator, it is sometimes useful to rearrange it so that the
     denominator is a rational number. This is called rationalising the denominator.

      = The rules to rationalise denominators are:

              For fractions in the form i multiply the numerator and denominator by va.
                                           a

          *   For fractions in the form        d        , multiply the numerator and denominator by (a-\b).
                                        a+ vb
          *   For fractions in the form   2 a multiply the numerator and denominator by (a + vb).

A function is a mathematical relationship that maps each value of a set of inputs
to a single output. The notation f(x) is used to represent a function of x.

= The set of possible inputs for a function is called the domain.           Domain       f@)=9         Range
= The set of possible outputs of a function is called the range.

This diagram shows how the function f(x) = x? maps
five values in its domain to values in its range.

     @ The discriminant
     If you square any real number, the result is greater than or equal to 0.
     This means that if » is negative, y cannot be a real number. Look at the quadratic formula:

                  in                   If the value under the square root sign is :negative, x cannot be

        The value of the discriminant shows how many roots f(x) has:
        *   If b? - 4ac > 0 then f(x) has two distinct real roots.
        *   If b? - 4ac = 0 then f(x) has one repeated root.
        *   If b? - 4ac < 0 then f(x) has no real roots.

                 The set of possible inputs of a function is called the domain.

                 The set of possible outputs of a function is called the range.

                 The roots of a function are the values of x for which f(x) = 0.

             7   You can find the coordinates of a turning point of a quadratic graph by completing
                 the square. If f(x) = a(x + p)* + g, the graph of y = f(x) has a turning point at (-p, q).

                 For the quadratic function f(x) = ax* + bx + c = 0, the expression b? — 4ac is
                 called the discriminant. The value of the discriminant shows how many roots f(x) has:

                 + If b? -4ac > 0 then the quadratic function has two distinct real roots.

                 + If b? — 4ac = 0 then the quadratic function has one repeated real root.

         You must be able to solve simultaneous equations where one equation is linear and one is quadratic.

         To solve simultaneous equations involving one linear equation and one quadratic equation,
         you need to use a substitution method from the linear equation into the quadratic equation.

         = Simultaneous equations with one linear and one quadratic equation can have up to two pairs
              of solutions. You need to make sure the solutions are paired correctly.

      Summary of key points

      1   Linear simultaneous equations can be solved using elimination or substitution.

      2   Simultaneous equations with one linear and one quadratic equation can have up to
          two pairs of solutions. You need to make sure the solutions are paired correctly.

      3 The solutions of a pair of simultaneous equations represent the points of intersection
          of their graphs.

      4   Fora   pair of simultaneous equations that produce a quadratic equation of the form
          ax? + bx +c=0:
          + be-4ac>0         two real solutions
          + b?-4ac=0         one real solution
          + be-4ac<0         no real solutions

      5 The solution of an inequality is the set of all real numbers x that make the inequality true.

      6 To solve a quadratic inequality:
          + Rearrange so that the right-hand side of the inequality is 0
          + Solve the corresponding quadratic equation to find the critical values
          + Sketch the graph of the quadratic function
          + Use your sketch to find the required set of values.

      7   The values of x for which the curve y = f(x) is below the curve y = g(x) satisfy the inequality
          f(x) < g(x).

          The values of x for which the curve y = f(x) is above the curve y = g(x) satisfy the inequality
          f(x) > g(x).

      8 y<f(x) represents the points on the coordinate grid below the curve
                                                                          y = f(x).
          y > f(x) represents the points on the coordinate grid above the curve y = f(x).

      9   If y> f(x) ory < f(x) then the curve
                                             y = f(x) is not included in the region and is represented by
          a dotted line.
          If y = f(x) ory < f(x) then the curve
                                              y = f(x) is included in the region and is represented by a
          solid line.

     @ Cubic graphs
     Acubic function has the form f(x) = ax? + bx? + cx + d, where a, b, cand dare real numbers
     and ais non-zero.
     The graph of a cubic function can take several different forms, depending on the exact nature
     of the function.

                                For these two functions a is positive.    For these two functions a is negative.

      = If        pis a root of the function f(x), then the graph of y = f(x) touches or crosses
          the x-axis at the point (p, 0).

     You can sketch the graph of a cubic function by finding the roots of the function.


      Example

      Sketch the curves with the following equations and show the points where they cross the
     coordinate axes.

        You can transform the graph of a function by altering the function. Adding or subtracting a
        constant ‘outside’ the function translates a graph vertically.

         = The graph of y = f(x) + ais a translation of the graphy = f(x) by the vector (°).
        Adding or subtracting a constant ‘inside’ the function translates the graph horizontally.

         = The graph of y = f(x + a) is a translation of the graphy = f(x) by the vector (a)

The cosine rule can be used to work out missing sides or angles in triangles.
= This version of the cosine rule is used to find a missing side if you know two sides
  and the angle between them:

You can use the standard trigonometric ratios for right-angled triangles to prove the cosine rule:

                   h? + x? = b?

  and     h? + (c- x)? =a?

  So      x? -(c- x? = b? - a?
               2ex - c? = b? - a?
                        a@=b?+c2-2ex        (1)

  but                     x=bcosA           (2)

  So                    a? = b? +c? - 2be cos A




If you are given all three sides and asked to find an angle, the cosine rule can be rearranged.
              A= bh? + 2
        a+ 2becos
                          — a®
           2becosA = b? +c?
                             P+e-a
 Hence             cos A =
                                  2be

You can exchange the letters depending on which angle you want to find.

               B+e-a

      @ Radian measure
      So far you have probably only measured angles in degrees, with one degree representing 355 ofa
      complete revolution around a circle.

      You can also measure angles in units called radians. 1 radian is the angle subtended at the centre
      of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.

        @ Gradients of curves
         The gradient of a curve is constantly changing. You can use a tangent to find the gradient of a
         curve at any point on the curve. The tangent to a curve at a point 4 is the straight line that just
         touches the curve at A.

         = The gradient of a curve at a given point is defined as the gradient of the tangent to the curve
           at that point.




                                                               The tangent to the curve at (1, 0) has gradient 1,
                                                               so the gradient of the curve at the point (1, 0) is
                                                               equal
                                                                   to 1.


                                                               The tangent just touches the curve at (1, 0).
                                                               It does not cut the curve at this point, although
                                                               it may cut the curve at another point.

      @ Finding the derivative
       Differentiation from first principles is not examined. It is included here to give a detailed account of where
       differentiation originates.

       You can use algebra to find the exact gradient of a curve at a given point. This diagram shows
       two points, 4 and B, that lie on the curve with equation y = f(x).

         This means that the gradient of the curve at 4 is the limit of this expression as the value of h

         Constant terms disappear when         you differentiate. This means that when you differentiate functions
         that only differ in the constant term, they will all differentiate to give the same function. To allow for
         this, you need to add a constant of integration at the end of a function when you integrate.

      & Finding functions
       You can find the constant of integration, c, when
       you are given (i) any point (x, y) that the curve of
       the function passes through or (ii) any value that
                                           d
       the function takes. For example, if = = 3x? then
      y =x? +c. There are infinitely many curves with
       this equation, depending on the value of c.


        Only one of these curves passes through
        this point. Choosing a point on the curve
        determines the value of c.




       = To find the constant of integration, c

         *    Integrate the function

         +    Substitute the values (x, y) of a point on the curve, or the value of the function at a given
              point f(x) = k, into the integrated function

         *    Solve the equation to find c

       The curve C with equation y = f(x) passes through the point (4, 5). Given that f(x)
       find the equation of C.



                                                                   First write f'(x) in a form suitable for integration.



                                                                   Integrate as normal and don't forget the + c.




                                                                   Use the fact that the curve passes through (4, 5).


         So
                                                                   Remember 4? = 25.
