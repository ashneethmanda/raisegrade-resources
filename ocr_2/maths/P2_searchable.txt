1.3) The factor theorem
 The factor theorem is a quick way of finding simple linear factors of a polynomial.


 TM The factor theorem states that if f(x) is a                             Watch out
      polynomial then:                                                                  wo statement:
      *    If f(p) =0, then (x — p) is a factor of f(x).                     ‘
      *    If (x—p) is a factor of f(x), then f(p) = 0.

      ° if (2) = 0, then (ax — b) is a factor of fix).
      * If (ax — b) is a factor of f(x) then (2) =0.
 You can use the factor theorem to quickly factorise a cubic function, g(x):

 1 Substitute values into the function until you find a value
                                                            p such that g(p) = 0.

 2.   Divide the function by (x—p).                         The remainder
                                                                     i    will
                                                                            i be0 because (x ~p)isafi
                                                                                             — p) is a factor ofg(x). .


 3.   Write g(x) = (x—p)(ax? + bx +0)                                               The other factor will be quadratic.




 4 Factorise the quadratic factor, if possible, to write g(x) as a product of three linear factors.




 Example 5)                 ECE ANALYSIS
 Show that (x — 2) is a factor of x° + x? - 4x - 4 by:

 a algebraic division                    b the factor theorem

                             2x-4
                             2x-4
                                   fe)

          So (x - 2) is a factor of x9 + x? - 4x - 4.


      b f(x) = x8 +x? -4x-4                                            Wi                  1S a function.
          f(2) = (2)? + (2)? - 4(2)- 4                             ‘                       he polynomial
              =8+4-8-4

              =0

          So (x - 2) is a factor of x3 + x? - 4x - 4.

        A mathematical proof needs to show that something is true in every case.

        = You can prove a mathematical statement is true by deduction. This means starting from known
          facts or definitions, then using logical steps to reach the desired conclusion.

        Here is an example of proof by deduction:

        Statement: The product of two odd numbers is odd.
        Demonstration: 5 x 7 = 35, which is odd                         This is demonstration but it is not a proof.
                                                                        You have only shown one case.
        Proof: p and q are integers, so 2p + 1 and 2q +1 —
        are odd numbers.                                                You can use 2p + 1 and 2q +1 to
                                                                        represent any odd numbers. If you can
               (2p + 1) x (2q + 1) = 4pq+2p+2q+1                        show that (2p + 1) x (2q + 1) is always an
                                  =2(2pqtp+q+1                          odd number then you have proved the

        Since p and g are integers, 2pq + p + q is also an integer.     Statement forall-cases,
        So 2(2pq + p + g) + 1 is one more than an even number.

        So the product of two odd numbers is an odd number. This is the statement of proof.

             @® Methods of proof
              A mathematical statement can be proved by exhaustion. For example, you can prove that the sum
              of two consecutive square numbers between 100 and 200 is an odd number. The square numbers
              between 100 and 200 are 121, 144, 169, 196.

              121+ 144=265whichisodd                  144+ 169=313whichisodd                  169 + 196 = 365 which is odd

              So the sum of two consecutive square numbers between 100 and 200 is an odd number.

              = You can prove a mathematical statement is true by exhaustion. This means breaking the
                   statement into smaller cases and proving each case separately.

              This method is better suited to a small number of results. You cannot use one example to prove a
              statement is true, as one example is only one case.



              Example

              Prove that all square numbers are either a multiple of 4 or | more than a multiple of 4.

                                                                                                  Problem-solving
                For odd numbers:
                                                                                                       Consider the two cases, odd
                (2n + 1? = 4n? + 4n+1=4n(n +1) +1                                                      and even numbers, separately.

               An(n + 1) is a multiple of 4, so 4n(n + 1) + 1 is

                1 more than a multiple of 4.

       For even numbers:

       (2n)? = 4n2
       tL

       An? is a multiple of 4.
       All integers are either odd or even, so all

       square numbers are either a multiple of 4 or 1

       more than a multiple of 4.




     A mathematical statement can be disproved using a counter-example. For example, to prove
     that the statement ‘37 + 3 is a multiple of 6 for all values of ’ is not true you can use the counter-
     example when n = 2, as 3 x      2+ 3 =9 and 9 is not a multiple of 6.

     TM You can prove a mathematical statement is not true by a counter-example. A counter-example
       is an example that does not work for the statement. You do not need to give more than one, as
       one is sufficient to disprove a statement.




     Example

     Prove that the following statement is not true:

            ‘The sum of two consecutive prime numbers is always even.’

     | 2 and 3 are both prime
       2+3=5

       5 is odd


      So the statement is not true.

      Summary of key points

       1   When simplifying an algebraic fraction, factorise the numerator and denominator where
           possible and then cancel common factors.

      2    You can use long division to divide a polynomial by (x + p), where
                                                                            p is a constant.

      3 The factor theorem states that if f(x) is a polynomial then:
           + If f(p) =0, then (x —p) is a factor of f(x)

           + If (v—p) is a factor of f(x), then f(p) = 0

           olf (2) = 0 then (ax
                             — 5) is a factor
      4 The remainder theorem states that if a polynomial f(x) is divided by (ax
                                                                               — 5) then the

           remainder is (2)
      5    You can prove a mathematical statement is true by deduction. This means starting from
           known facts or definitions, then using logical steps to reach the desired conclusion.


      6    |Inamathematical proof you must

           + State any information or assumptions you are using

           + Show every step of your proof clearly

           + Make sure that every step follows logically from the previous step

           + Make sure you have covered all possible cases

           + Write a statement of proof at the end of your working


      7    To prove an identity you should

           + Start with the expression on one side of the identity

           + Manipulate that expression algebraically until it matches the other side

           + Show every step of your algebraic working


      8    You can prove a mathematical statement is true by exhaustion. This means breaking the
           statement into smaller cases and proving each case separately.


      9    You can prove a mathematical statement is not true by a counter-example. A counter-
           example is one example that does not work for the statement. You do not need to give more
           than one example, as one is sufficient to disprove a statement.

    @® Equation of a circle
      A circle is the set of points that are equidistant from a fixed point. You can use Pythagoras’ theorem
      to derive equations of circles on a coordinate grid.

      For any point (x, y) on the circumferenceof a circle, you can use Pythagoras’ theorem to show
      the relationship between x, y and the radius r.

      = The equation of a circle with centre (0, 0) and radius ris x? + y? = 12.

      When a circle has a centre (a, b) and radius r, you can use the following                    y
      general form of the equation of a circle.

      = The equation of the circle with centre (a, 5) and radius r is

     3.3) Laws of logarithms
      Expressions involving more than one logarithm can often be rearranged or simplified. For instance:

      log,x =m and log,y       =n ——_—_—____—— Take two logarithms with the same base

      x=aTMand y=a"                                             Rewrite these expressions using powers

      xy=a"xat=anen                                             Multiply these powers

      log,.xy    =m+n=log,x + log,y—————————— Rewrite your result using logarithms

      This result is one of the laws of logarithms.

      You can use similar methods to prove two further laws.

      = The laws of logarithms:

        * log,x + log,y = log, xy                  (the multiplication law) { Watch out ) You need to learn
        * log, x —log,y = log,     x               (the division law)               these three laws of logarithms,

                          x                        (the power law)

      TM You should also learn to recognise the following special cases:

        . log,(+) = log, (x1) = -log,x             (the power law when k = -1)
        *    log,a=1                               (a>0,a#1)

      Working in base a, suppose that:                        log,x =m                 logs to any base.

      Writing this as a power:                                    aTMT=x

      Taking logs to a different base b:                    log,aTM = log,
                                                                         x

      Using the power law:                                 mlog,a = log,x

      Writing m as log,
                      x:                            log,x X log,a = log,x

      This can be written as:
                                                                        log,x

@ Pascal’s triangle
 You can use Pascal's triangle to quickly expand expressions such as (x + 2).

 Consider the expansions of (a + b)" forn = 0, 1, 2,3 and 4:

 (a+ b=                                                         1

 (a+b)!=                                             la         +        1b


 (a+b=                                la              +        2ab          +       1                      Each coefficient is the sum of the two
 (a+b =                         le          +    diy            +       3abe        +       1p             coefficients immediately above it.

 (a+ b=                  lat     +    4abb            +        6a?          +   4ab?         +    1b4



                  Every term in the expansion of (a + b)" has total index n:

                  In the 6a*b? term the total index is 2 + 2 = 4.

                  In the 4ab? term the total index is 1 +3 = 4.


The coefficients in the expansions form a pattern that is known as Pascal's triangle.

 TM Pascal's triangle is formed by adding adjacent pairs of numbers to find the numbers on the
         next row.


 Here are the first 7 rows of Pascal's triangle:

                                        1

                                 1              1

                               SS WA,                                                            coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)2.

 = The (7 + 1)th row of Pascal’s triangle gives the coefficients in the expansion of (a + 5)".



 Example


 Use Pascal's triangle to find the expansions of:

a (x+2y)3                                                     b (2x-5)




     a    (x + 2y3
          The coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1 so:

          (x + 2y)> = 1x3 + 3x?(2y) + 3x(2y)? + 1(2y)>

                         = x3 + Gx2y + 12xy? + By3

        @ Factorial notation
         You can use combinations and factorial notation to help you expand binomial expressions. For larger
         indices, it is quicker than using Pascal's triangle.
                                                                                           LOGEC        You say ‘n factorial’.

              @ The binomial expansion
              A binomial expression has two terms. The binomial expansion allows you to expand powers of
               binomial expressions. For example, in the expansion of (a + b)> = (a+ b)(a + b)(a + b)(a + b)(a + 5) the

              term a2b} occurs @) times. This is because you need to choose b 3 times from the 5 brackets. You can
               do this in é3s) ways so when the expansion is simplified, the term in a2b? is (Baer.

        @ Binomial estimation
         In engineering and science, it is often useful to find simple approximations for complicated
         functions. If the value of x is less than 1, then x” gets smaller as n gets larger. If x is small you can
         sometimes ignore large powers of x to approximate a function or estimate a value.

@® Recurrence relations
 If you know the rule to get from one term to the next in a sequence you can write a recurrence relation.

 = Arecurrence relation of the form u,,, , = f(u,) defines each term of a sequence as a function of
      the previous term.

 For example, the recurrence relation wu,; = 2u, + 3, uy, = 6 produces the following sequence:
          (|

             @® Modelling with series
              You can model real-life situations with series. For example if a person’s salary increases by the same
              percentage every year, their salaries each year would form a geometric sequence and the amount they
              had been paid in total over 7 years would be modelled by the corresponding geometric series.




              Ahmed starts a new company. In year | his profits will be $20 000. He predicts his profits to
              increase by $5000 each year, so that his profits in year 2 are modelled to be $25 000, in year 3,
              $30 000 and so on. He predicts this will continue until he reaches annual profits of $100 000. He
              then models his annual profits to remain at $100 000.

              a Calculate the profits for Ahmed’s business in the first 20 years.

              b State one reason why this may not be a suitable model.

              ¢ Ahmed’s financial advisor says the yearly profits are likely to increase by 5% per annum.
                   Using this model, calculate the profits for Ahmed’s business in the first 20 years.


                a   Year 1 P= 20000,       Year 2 P= 25000,        —

                    Year 3 P= 30000

                     100 000 = 20000 +       (n - 1)(5000)

                     100 000 = 20000 + 5000n - 5000

                    85 000 = 5000n

                    Seo =    1020000 + 3(100000)

                        = 1320000

                    So Ahmed’s total profit after 20 years is

                    $1320000.

           b    It is unlikely that Ahmed’s profits will

                     In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

                     first term and dis the common difference.

                     An arithmetic series is the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence.

                    The sum of the first 2 terms of an arithmetic series is given by S, = 3 (2a + (n - 1)d), where
                     where ais the first term and dis the common difference.

                     You can also write this formula as S, =F la +1), where /is the last term.

                     A geometric sequence has a common ratio between consecutive terms.

                    The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is u, = ar"~1, where a is the first term
                     and r is the common ratio.

                    The Greek capital letter ‘sigma’ is used to signify a sum. You write it as )>. You write limits on
                     the top and bottom to show which terms you are summing.

                    Arecurrence relation of the form w,,,; = f(w,) defines each term of a sequence as a function of
                     the previous term.

        @ Definite integrals
         You can calculate an integral between two limits. This is called a definite integral. A definite integral
         usually produces a value whereas an indefinite integral always produces a function.

         Here are the steps for integrating the function 3x? between the limits x = 1 and x =2.


                                                                                       Write the integral in []

                are from x =     1to x =2.

         There are three stages when you work out a definite integral:

                Write the definite integral             Integrate, and write the       Evaluate the definite integral

         = If f(x) is the derivative of f(x) for all
              values of x in the interval [a, 5], then the

             @® Areas under curves
              Definite integration can be used to find the area under a curve.
              For any curve with equation y = f(x), you can define the area
              under the curve to the left of x as a function of x called A(x).
              As x increases, this area A(x) also increases (since x moves
              further to the right).


              If you look at a small increase in x, say 5x, then the area                            This vertical height
              increases by an amount 64 = A(x + 5x) — A(x).                                          will be y = f(x).

              This increase in the 54 is approximately rectangular
              and of magnitude ydx. (As you make 5x smaller any error
              between the actual area and this will be negligible.)                          A(x)              y=fe)

If you cannot integrate a function algebraically, you can use a numerical method to approximate the
area beneath a curve.

Consider the curve y = f(x):                                      v=o)




                                          b

To approximate the area given by | ydx, you can divide
                                     la


the area up into n equal strips. Each strip will be of width h,
            b-a
where h =

boundary of one of the strips. So you find y forx =a,x=a+h,              Hint ) Nedhe dietierasulss
Next you calculate the value of y for each value of x that forms a                    .                  ;

                                                                            there will ben + 1 values of x

You can label these values Vo, Vy, Var V3 «+




Finally you join adjacent points to form n trapeziums and approximate the original area by the sum of
the areas of these n trapeziums.

That the area of a trapezium like this:

is given by (yo + y,)h. The required area under the curve is therefore given by:

Factorising gives:

     [vax = tn» HVA + V2 + Vt Vn-1 t+ Vn + Yn)
  or [vax = tno» + 2(py + Vo + 0. + Yn—1) + Yn)
This formula is given in the formula booklet but you will need to know how to use it.

         places) in the above example that increasing the number of strips (or reducing their width) should
         improve the accuracy of the approximation.
