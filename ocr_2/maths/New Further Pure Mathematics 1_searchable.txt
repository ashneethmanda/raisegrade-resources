            z=xX + iy, the modulus is given by |z| =      x2 + y*.

        The argument of a complex number is the angle its
        corresponding vector makes with the positive real axis.

@® Modulus-argument form of complex numbers
 You can write any complex number in terms of its modulus and argument.
 = For a complex number z with |z| = and argz = 0, the modulus-argument form of z is
   z=r(cos@ + isin 6).

                                        From the right-angled triangle, x = rcos@ and y = rsin@.

                                        z=x+ip=rcosd + irsind = r(cosé + isind)

                                        This formula works for a complex number in any quadrant of the Argand diagram.
                                        The argument, 6, is usually given in the range —7 < @ < 7, although the formula
                                        works for any value of @ measured anticlockwise from the positive real axis.

     @ Roots of quadratic equations
      = For real numbers a, b and ¢, if the roots of the quadratic equation az? + bz + c = 0 are non-real
        complex numbers, then they occur as a conjugate pair.

      Another way of stating this is that for a real-valued quadratic function f(z), if z, is a root of f(z) = 0
      then z,* is also a root. You can use this fact to find one root if you know the other, or to find the

solve the equation completely.

            ,2=-5

      So the roots of 224 - 323 - 392? + 120z - 50 = O are:

                             SED            core rnc


     Show that 2? + 4 is a factor of z4 - 223 + 212° - 82 + 68.
     Hence solve the equation z* — 2z3 + 21z? - 82 + 68 = 0.


       Using long division:
                 22 — 22417
      22 + A)z4 — 223 + 212? — 82 + 6B

      There is no remainder and hence z* + 4 is a factor of
       24 — 223 + 2127 — 8z + GB.


       So z4 — 223 + 212? - 8z + 68 = (2? + 4)(z? - 22 +17) =O
       Either z? + 4 =O or z?- 2z7+17=0

       Solving z2 + 4 =0:
      |22=-4
       z=+2i

       Solving 2? - 22 + 17 =O:
       (2-1)? +16=0

                 2   An imaginary number is a number of the form bi, where b € R.

                 3   Acomplex number is written in the form a + bi, where a,bER.

                 4   Complex numbers can be added or subtracted by adding or subtracting their real parts and
                     adding or subtracting their imaginary parts.

                 5   You can multiply a real number by a complex number by multiplying out the brackets in the
                     usual way.
26                                                                 COMPLEX NUMBERS




          If b? — 4ac < 0 then the quadratic equation ax* + bx + c = 0 has two distinct complex roots,
          neither of which is real.


          For any complex number z = a + bi, the complex conjugate of the number is defined as
          z*=a-    bi.


          For real numbers a, b and c, if the roots of the quadratic equation az* + bz + c =Oare
          non-real complex numbers, then they occur as a conjugate pair.


          If the roots ofa quadratic equation are a and 3, then you can write the equation as

          (z-a)(z- 8) =Oorz*- (a+ f)z+aG8=0.


     10   If f(c) is a polynomial with real coefficients, and z, is a root of f(z) = 0,
          then z,* is also a root of f(z) = 0.


     11   An equation of the form az? + bz? + cz + d= is called a cubic equation, and has three roots.
          For a cubic equation with real coefficients, either:

          e all three roots are real, or

          @ one root is real and the other two roots form a complex conjugate pair.


     12   An equation of the form az‘ + bz? + cz* + dz + e = Ois called a quartic equation,
          and has four roots.

          For a quartic equation with real coefficients, either:

          e all four roots are real, or

          @ two roots are real and the other two roots form a complex conjugate pair, or

          @ two roots form a complex conjugate pair and the other two roots also form
             a complex conjugate pair.


     13   You can represent complex numbers on an Argand diagram. The x-axis on an Argand
          diagram is called the real axis and the y-axis is called the imaginary axis. The complex
          number z = x + iy is represented on the diagram by the point P(x, y), where x and y are
          Cartesian coordinates.


     14   The complex number z = x + iy can be represented as the vector (3) onan Argand diagram.

     15   The modulus of a complex number, |z|, is the distance from the origin to that number on an
          Argand diagram. For a complex number
                                             z = x + iy, the modulus is given by |z| = yx? + y?.

     16   The argument of a complex number, arg z, is the angle between the positive real axis and
          the line joining that number to the origin on an Argand diagram. For a complex number
          z=x + iy, the argument, 0, satisfies tand = ps

          17   Let a be the positive acute angle made with the real axis
               by the line joining the origin and z.

               e If   zlies in the first quadrant, then argz = a.

               e If zlies in the second quadrant, then argz =a -a.

               e If   zlies in the third quadrant, then argz = —(x — a).

               e If   zlies in the fourth quadrant, then argz = —a.
                                                                             argz =-(7-a)   argz=-a




          18   For a complex number z with |z| =r and argz = 0,
               the modulus-argument form of z is        z= r(cos@ + isin).

    @&            Locating roots
     . a of a function is a value of x for                      t Links ) The following two things are identical:
     which f(x) = 0. The graph of y = f(x) will                      « the roots of the function f(x)

     to the roots ofthe function.
     You can sometimes show that a root exists within a given interval by showing that the function
     changes sign (from positive to negative, or vice versa) within the interval.

                                              ANALYSIS



     The diagram shows a sketch of the curve y = f(x),                                4
     where f(x) = x3 — 4x2 + 3x41.                                                                                 f(x) = 4x2 +341

     a Explain how the graph shows that f(x) has
        a root between x = 2 and x = 3.

     b Show that f(x) has a root between
        x=14andx=155.




       a   The graph crosses the x-axis between
                                                                                     The graph of y = f(x) crosses the x-axis
           xX = 2 and x = 3. This means that a root of
                                                                                     whenever f(x) = 0.
           f(x) lies between x = 2 and x = 3.

       b   (1.4) = (1.4)5 — 4(1.4)? + 3(1.4) + 1 = 0.104
                                                                                     f(1.4) > 0 and f(1.5) < 0, so there isa
           f(1.5) = (1.5)5 — 4(1.5)? + 3(1.5) + 1 = -O.125
                                                                                     change of sign.
           There is a change of sign for f(x) between

           1.4 and 1.5, so there is at least one root
                                                                                     f(x) changes sign in the interval [1.4, 1.5],
           between x = 1.4 and x = 1.5.
                                                                                     so f(x) must equal zero within this interval.


     There are three situations you need to watch out for when using the change of sign rule to locate
     roots. A change of sign does not necessarily mean there is exactly one root, and the absence of a
     sign change does not necessarily mean that a root does not exist in the interval.

          The equation f(x) = 0 has a root in the interval [3, 4].

          Using this interval, find an approximation to x.



     (3.4 ) The Newton-Raphson method
      The Newton-Raphson method can be used to find numerical solutions to equations
      of the form f(x) = 0. You need to be able to differentiate f(x) to use this method.

              Xns1 =n
                            Fx,

      The method uses tangent lines to find increasingly accurate approximations of a root. The value of
      X41 is the point at which the tangent to the graph at (x, f(x,)) intersects the x-axis.

      If the starting value is not chosen carefully, the Newton-Raphson method might converge on
      a root very slowly, or can fail completely. If the initial value, x9, is near a turning point or the
      derivative at this point, f’ (xo), is close to zero, then the tangent at (xo, f(xo)) will intercept the
      x-axis a long way from xo.

            If any value, x,, in the Newton-Raphson method is at a turning
            point, the method will fail because f’(x,) = 0 and the formula
            would result in division by zero, which is not valid. Graphically,
            the tangent line will run parallel to the x-axis, therefore never

Summary of key points

1    You can locate roots of an equation f(x) = 0, if f(x) is continuous in the interval [a, 5], and fia)
     and f(b) have opposite signs. The change of sign indicates an intersection on the x-axis, and
     hence there is a root of the equation.


     You can solve equations of the form f(x) = 0 using interval bisection.
     If you find an interval in which f(x) changes sign, then the interval must contain a root of
     the equation f(x) = 0. You can then take the midpoint as the first approximation and repeat
     this process until you get the required accuracy.


     You can solve equations of the form f(x) = 0 using linear interpolation.

     You can solve equations of the form f(x) = 0 using the Newton-Raphson method.

     The Newton-Raphson method may not always give you a better approximation and may take
     you further away from the root.

@ Parametric equations
 Parametric equations are where the x and y coordinates of each point on a curve are expressed in
the form of an independent variable, say ¢, which is called a parameter. The parametric equation
 of a curve is written in the form:

      x= fo, y= 80
You can define the coordinates of any point on a curve by using parametric equations.




 Sketch the curve given by the parametric equations x = a’, y = 2at,    rE R,
where a is a positive constant.



  To get an idea of the shape of the curve, choose some values for ¢.

  Let’s say f = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,3

      a_   focus (7, O) and directrix

      a y?= 24x

           So the focus has coordinates (6, O)

           and the directrix has equation x + 6 = 0.

 d= V(x) - x1 + (2-1).                                                      a

 This formula can also be written in the form
 d? = (x). -— xP + O2- V1)

  5.2) Matrix multiplication
    Two matrices can be multiplied together. Unlike the operations we have seen so far,
    this is completely different from normal arithmetic multiplication.

    = Matrices can be multiplied together if the number                                  { Notation } If AB exists, then matrix
         of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number                              Ais said to be multiplicatively
         of rows in the second matrix.                                                      conformable with matrix B.
MATRICES                                                                                                          81




           The product matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix, and the same number
           of columns as the second matrix.




           The order in which you multiply matrices is important. This has two consequences:

           ¢ In general, AB + BA (even if A and B are both square matrices).

           ¢ If AB exists, BA does not necessarily exist (e.g., if A is a 3 x 2 matrix and Bis a2 x 4 matrix).

           = To find the product of two multiplicatively conformable matrices, you multiply the elements in
                each row in the left-hand matrix by the corresponding elements in each column in the right-hand
                matrix, then add the results together.

               (starting top left) are 1 and all the remaining elements are 0. Identity matrices are

               denoted by I, where k describes the size. The 2 x 2 identity matrix is I, = ( 5 )

           4 Toadd or subtract matrices, you add or subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix.
               You can add or subtract matrices only when they are the same size.


           5 To multiply a matrix by a scalar, you multiply every element in the matrix by that scalar.


           6   + Matrices can be multiplied together if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal
                 to the number of rows in the second matrix. In this case the first matrix is said to be
                 multiplicatively conformable with the second matrix.

               + To find the product of two multiplicatively conformable matrices, you multiply the elements
                 in each row in the left-hand matrix by the corresponding elements in each column in the
                 right-hand matrix, then add the results together.

       @ Linear transformations in two dimensions
        You can define a transformation in two dimensions by describing how a general
                                                                                             point with

        position vector () is transformed. The new point is called the image.

        The three transformations S, T and U are defined as follows. Find the

        under each of these transformations.

        A linear transformation has the special properties
        that the transformation involves only linear terms
        in x and y. In the example above, T is a linear
        transformation while S and U are not.

You can visualise this transformation by considering the unit square:

                                                 The origin does not change under a
                                                 linear transformation.


                                                 T(a+b) = Ta + Tb so you can add the two image

                                                 This means that the entire transformation can be

                                                 defined by the images of the unit vectors (3) and (9).

 Points which are mapped onto themselves under a given transformation are called
invariant points. Lines which map onto themselves are called invariant lines.

The only invariant point in the transformation above is the origin, which is always an invariant
 point of any linear transformation. The transformation above has invariant lines y = x and y =                 Xe

The transformation represented by the 2 x 2 matrix Q, is a reflection in the y-axis.

         Reflections and rotations of 2D shapes both preserve the area of a shape. When a shape
         is stretched, its area can increase or decrease. You can use the determinant of the matrix
         representing this transformation to work out the scale factor for the change in area.

           matrix M, det M represents the scale factor
           for the change in area. This is sometimes
           called the area scale factor.

              The only invariant point is the origin (0, 0). For @ # 180°, there are no invariant lines.
              For @ = 180°, any line passing through the origin is an invariant line.

           8 A transformation represented by the matrix (5 A is a stretch of scale factora parallel to the
              x-axis and a stretch of scale factor
                                                 b parallel to the y-axis.
              In the case where a = 5, the transformation is an enlargement with scale factor a.

           9 For any stretch of the above form, the x- and y-axes are invariant lines and the origin is an
              invariant point.

          10 For a stretch parallel to the x-axis only, points on the y-axis are invariant points, and any line
              parallel to the x-axis is an invariant line.

          11 Fora stretch parallel to the y-axis only, points on the x-axis are invariant points, and any line
              parallel to the y-axis is an invariant line.

          12 Fora linear transformation represented by matrix M, det M represents the scale factor for the
              change in area. This is sometimes called the area scale factor.

          13 The matrix PQ represents the transformation Q followed by the transformation P.

          14 The transformation described by the matrix A has the effect of
              reversing the transformation described by the matrix A.

         which is divisible by 4.

         f(n) is divisible by 4 when n = 1.

        Assume true for n = k, so that
         f(k) = 37* + 11 is divisible by 4.
         f(k + 1) = 32440 411
                 = 3% x 37 +11

                 = 9(374) + 11

         f(k + 1) — (k) = (9(374) + 11) - (374 + 11)
                        = (374)

          Assume that for n = k, u, = 3 - 2 is true fork € ZI

         Then up, = Bu, + 4

                      = 3(3- 2)+4

                      = 31-644
                      =3ttt_p


         Therefore, the general statement u, is true when

          n=k+1.

          If u, is true when n = k, then it has been shown that
          u, is also true whenn =k + 1. As u, is true forn = 1

          and n= 2 then u, is true for all > 1 andn € Z* by

          mathematical induction.



        In the basis step of the proof, the general statement was checked for both n = | and n = 2.
        This is because the first application of the recurrence formula u,, , ; = 3u, + 4 yields u, by
        using the first term uw, = 1.

      Given that w,,, >= Su, 4; — 6u,, u, = 13, uw, = 35, prove by induction that u, = 2"*! + 3"+!,


       n=1; u,= 2? + 3? = 13, as given.

       n= 2; up = 23 + 33 = 35, as given.

       n= 3; uz = 24 + 34 = 97, from the general statement,

       and uz = 5uz — 6, = 5(35) — 6(13) = 97,

        from the recurrence relation.

       So uy, is true when n = 1 and n = 2 and also when n = 3.

                   = 5(2k+2) + 5(3k+2) — (2k +1) - E(3k+1)


                   = 5(2k+2) + 5(3k+2) — 3(2k*2) — 2(3k +2)

                   = 2(2k+2)

                   = 2k+3
                       4 3k+3


                   = Qkt2+14   Bk+241



        Therefore, the general statement u,, is true

        whenn=k + 2.

        If u, is true when n = k and n =k +1      then it has been           GPL   CP   SPO,   1 replaced   by   1
        shown that u, is also true when n = k + 2. As u, is
        true for n= 1, n= 2 and n= 3, then uy is true for
        alln > 1 and n € Z* by mathematical induction.



      In Example 9, each term of the sequence depends upon the previous two terms.
      Therefore u,, was assumed to be true for bothn =k andn=k+1.

              Summary      of key points

              1 You can use proof by induction to prove that a general statement is true for all
                positive integers.


              2 Proof by mathematical induction usually consists of the following four steps:

                * Basis: Show the general statement is true for n = 1.

                ¢ Assumption: Assume that the general statement is true for n =k.

                + Inductive: Show the general statement is true forn =k + 1.

                * Conclusion: State that the general statement is then true for all positive integers, n.
