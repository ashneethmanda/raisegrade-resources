2    CHAPTER 1




    @® Mathematical models
     A mathematical model is a simplification of a real-world situation. It can be used to make
     predictions and forecasts about real-world situations. This helps solve and improve the
     understanding of real-world situations by analysing the results and the model.

     The model will aim to include all the main features of the real-world situation but, given the
     difficulties of the real world, the model may have to be based on certain assumptions. As a result,
     these assumptions will need to be taken into consideration when analysing the results.

     There are many advantages of mathematical models, and these include (but are not limited to):

     TM they are relatively quick and easy to produce

     = simplification of the real-world situation can cause errors, as the model does not include all
       aspects of the problem and may have included some assumptions

       real world.

The process of designing a model generally involves seven stages, outlined below.

Stage 1: The recognition of a real-world problem

Stage 2: A mathematical model is devised

Stage 3: Model used to make predictions about the
          behaviour of the real-world problem

Stage 4: Experimental data are collected from the real world

Stage 5: Comparisons are made against the devised model

Stage 6: Statistical concepts are used to test how well the
          model describes the real-world problem

Stage 7: Model is refined



Example             | SKILLS 4 EXECUTIVE FUNCTION
A scientist is investigating the population of owls and notices that the population varies year
to year. Give a summary of the stages that are needed to create a mathematical model for this
population variation.

1   Some assumptions need to be made to ensure the model is manageable. Birth and death rates of
    owls should be included, but food supply and environment changes should not.

2 Plana mathematical model which will include diagrams.

3 Use this model to predict the population of the owls over a period of years.

4 Include and collect fresh data that match the conditions of the predicted values. You may also
    use historical data from the previous years.

5 Analyse the data using techniques you will meet in this course to compare the predicted data
    with the experimental data.

6 Use statistical tests that will provide an objective means of deciding if the differences between
    the model’s predictions and experimental data are within acceptable limits.

If the predicted values do not match the experimental data closely enough, then the model can be
refined. This will involve repeating and refining steps 2-6. This model is then constantly refined
making the model more and more accurate.

@ Types of data
 In statistics, we collect observations or measurements of some variables. These observations are
 known as data. Variables associated with non-numerical data are qualitative variables, and variables
 associated with numerical data are quantitative variables. The flowchart below shows different
 types of data in more detail.

         Large amounts of discrete data can be written as a frequency table or as grouped data.
         For example, the table below shows the number of students with a specific shoe size.


           Shoe size(x)        Number of             The number of anything is called its frequency,
                               students, f           wheref stands for frequency.

                40                   17              A frequency table is a quick way of writing a long
                41                   29              list of numbers. For instance, this table tells us that
                42                   34              3 students have a shoe size of 39, and 17 students
                                                     have a shoe size of 40, etc.
                43                   12


         Data can also be presented as a grouped frequency table. The specific data values are not
         included in the table, instead they are grouped. You will need to know:

         = the groups are commonly known as classes

    { Hint } Sometimes it is not possible or practical to count the number of all the objects
        in a set, but that number is still discrete. For example, counting the number of apples
        on all the trees in an orchard or the number of bricks in a multi-storey building might
        not be possible (or desirable!) but nonetheless these are still discrete numbers.

       2.2) Measures of central tendency
         A measure of location is a single value which describes a position in a data set. If the single value
         describes the centre of the data, it is called a measure of central tendency. You should already
         know how to work out the mean, median and modeof a set of ungrouped data and from ungrouped
         frequency tables.

         = The mode or modal class is the value or class that occurs most often.

         = The median is the middle value when the data values are put in order.

         = The mean can be calculated using the

              formula ¥ = ae                                     e X represents the mean of the data. You say ‘x bar’.
                                                                 e x represents the sum of the data values.
                                                                 e   nis the number of data values.


         Combining means

         If set A, of size m;, has mean X, and set B, of size m2, has a mean X2, then the mean of the combined
         set of
              A and Bis:

        You need to decide on the best measure to use in particular situations.

         = Mode = This is used when data are qualitative, or when quantitative with either a single mode or
                      two modes (bimodal). There is no mode if each value occurs just once.

         ® Median This is used for quantitative data. It is usually used when there are extreme values, as they
                      do not affect it as much as they affect the mean.

         = Mean       This is used for quantitative data and uses all the pieces of data. It therefore gives a true
                       measure of the data. However, it is affected by extreme values.

        @ Other measures of location
         The median describes the middle of the data set. It splits the data set into two equal (50%) halves.

         You can calculate other measures of location such as quartiles and percentiles.

     When data are presented in a grouped
     frequency table you can use a technique called
     interpolation to estimate the median, quartiles
     and percentiles. When you use interpolation,
     you are assuming that the data values are
     evenly distributed within each class.

     = The range is the difference between the largest                              dispersion or measures of variation.
       and smallest values in the data set.

     = The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between
       the upper quartile and the lower quartile, Q; — Qy.

     The range takes into account all of the data but can be affected by extreme values. The interquartile
     range is not affected by extreme values but only considers the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

     = The interpercentile range is the difference between the values for two given percentiles.

     The 10th to 90th interpercentile range is often used since it is not affected by extreme values but still
     considers 80% of the data in its calculation.

     @® Variance and standard deviation
      Another measure that can be used to work out the spread of a data set is the variance.
      This makes use of the fact that each data point deviates from the mean by the amount x — ¥.

                              Sy.
      The third version, a is easier to use if you can use your calculator to find S,, quickly.

      The units of the variance are the units of the data squared. You can find a related measure of spread
      that has the same units as the data.

      = The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

       @® Coding
         Coding is a way of simplifying statistical calculations. Each data value is coded to make a new set of
         data values which are easier to work with.

         In your exam, you will usually have to code values using a formula like this: y

         where a and b are constants that you have to choose, or are given with the question.

         When data are coded, different statistics change in different ways.

       5 To find the lower quartile for discrete data, divide n by 4. If this is a whole number, the lower
           quartile is halfway between this data point and the one above. If it is not a whole number,
           round up and pick this data point.

       6 To find the upper quartile for discrete data, find 3 of n. If this is a whole number, the upper
           quartile is halfway between this data point and the one above. If it is not a whole number,
           round up and pick this data point.

       7   The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set.

       8 The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the upper quartile
           and the lower quartile, Q; — Q,.

       9 The interpercentile range is the difference between the values for two given percentiles.

     @& Histograms
      Grouped continuous data can be represented in a histogram.

      Generally, a histogram gives a good picture of how the data are distributed. It enables you to see a
      rough location, the general shape and how spread out the data are.

      In a histogram, the area of the bar is proportional (related in size) to the frequency in each class.
      This allows you to use a histogram to represent grouped data with unequal class intervals.

        height of each bar (the frequency                                  90             =         ]

         An outlier is an extreme value that lies outside the overall pattern of the data.

         There are a number of different ways of calculating outliers, depending on the nature of the data and
         the calculations that you are asked to carry out.

           A commen definition of an outlier is any value that is:                          { Notation ) Q, and Q, are the
               either greater than Q, + k(Q; — Q,)                                             first and third quartiles.
           © orless than Q; — k(Q; - Q,)

         In the exam, you will be told which method to use to identify
         outliers in data sets, including the value of k.

     Sometimes outliers are legitimate values (values that are acceptable according to the rules)
     which could be correct. For example, there really could be a giant African land snail 32 cm long.

     However, there are occasions when an outlier should be removed from the data since it is clearly an
     error and it would be misleading to keep it in. These data values are known as anomalies (values that
     are different from what is normal or expected).

                        SKILLS     INTERPRETATION


 a Draw a box plot for the data on blood glucose levels of females from Example 3.
       Lower quartile = 3.2

       Upper quartile = 4.0

       Median              = 3.8
      Outlier              =17
       Lowest value        = 2.2

       Highest value       = 5.1

 The blood glucose levels of 30 males are recorded. The results are summarised below:
       Lower quartile = 3.6

       Upper quartile = 4.7

       Median            =4.0
       Lowest value        = 1.4

       Highest value     = 5.2

 An outlier is an observation that falls either 1.5 x the interquartile range above the upper quartile
 or 1.5 x the interquartile range below the lower quartile.

 b Given that there is only one outlier for the males, draw a box plot for these data on the same
    diagram as the one for females.

 ¢ Compare the blood glucose levels for males and females.

     3.5) Skewness
      The shape (skewness) of a data set can be described using diagrams, measures of location and
      measures of spread.
      = A distribution can be symmetrical, have a positive skew or have a negative skew.

      = Data which are spread evenly are symmetrical.

      = Data which are mostly at lower values have a positive skew.

      = Data which are mostly at higher values have a negative skew.

      There are several ways of comparing skewness. Sometimes you will be told which to use,
      and sometimes you will have to choose one depending on what data you have available.

         Another test uses the measures of location:

         TM Mode = median = mean describes a distribution which is symmetrical

         TM Mode < median < mean describes a distribution with a positive skew

         TM Mode > median > mean describes a distribution with a negative skew

                                3(mean — median)
         You can also calculate ————-—~—__— which tells you how skewed the data are.
                                standard deviation

                                                             0


         = Avalue of 0 implies that the mean = median and the distribution is symmetrical

         = A positive value implies that the median < mean and the distribution is positively skewed

         TM A negative value implies that median > mean and the distribution is negatively skewed

         The further from 0 the value is, the more likely the data will be skewed.

® 2 Cross-country runners from the Marathon Club and the Runners Club were keen
       to see which club had the faster runners overall. They decided that all the members
       from both clubs would take part in a cross-country run. The time each runner took
       to complete the run was recorded.

       The results are summarised in the box plots.

          Summary of key points

            1   Acommon definition of an outlier is any value that is:
                + greater than Q, + kQ,; — Q,)
                + or less than Q; — K(Q; - Q,)

                The process of removing anomalies from a data set is known as cleaning the data.

                On a histogram, to calculate the height of each bar (the frequency density) use the formula:

                area of bar = k x frequency

            4 Joining the middle of the top of each bar in a histogram forms a frequency polygon.

                When comparing data sets you can comment on:
                + ameasure of location
                + ameasure of spread

                A stem andleaf diagram reveals the shape of the data and enables quartiles to be found.

                Two sets of data can be compared using back to back stem and leafdiagrams.

                A box plot represents important features of the data. It shows quartiles, maximum and
                minimum values, and any outliers.

                Box plots can be used to compare two sets of data.

        @ Understanding the vocabulary used in probability
         If you want to predict the chance of something happening, you use probability.

         An experiment is a repeatable process that gives rise to a number of outcomes.

         An event is a collection of one or more outcomes.

         A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes.

         Where outcomes are equally likely, the probability of an event is the number of outcomes in the
         event divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

         All events have probability between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). Probabilities are usually written as
         fractions or decimals.

         Dice, cards, spinners, etc. are used as theoretical props throughout this chapter to explore the idea of
         chance and probability only.


         Example

         Two fair spinners each have four sectors numbered | to 4. The two spinners are spun together and
         the sum of the numbers indicated on each spinner is recorded.
         Find the probability of the spinners indicating
         asum of:

           @ Mutually exclusive and independent events
            When events have no outcomes in common they are called mutually exclusive.

            In a Venn diagram, the closed curves do not overlap and you can
                                                                                       A                    B
            use a simple addition rule to work out combined probabilities:

            = For mutually exclusive events, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

            When one event has no effect on another, they are independent.
            Therefore ifA and Bare independent, the probability of
                                                                 A
            happening is the same whether or not B happens.

            = For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

            You can use this multiplication rule to determine whether or not events are independent.

     @ Conditional probability
      The probability of an event can change depending on the outcomeof a previous event. For example,
      the probability of you being late for work may change depending on whether or not you oversleep.

      Situations like this can be modelled using conditional probability. You use a vertical line symbol ‘|’
      to indicate conditional probabilities.

      = The probability that B occurs given that A has already occurred is written as P(B| A).
      Similarly, P(B|
                    A’) describes the probability of B occurring given that A has not occurred.

      = For independent events, P(A | B) = P(A | B’) = P(A), and P(B|
                                                                    A) = P(B| A’) = P(B).
      You can use this condition to determine independence.

      You can solve some problems involving conditional probability by considering a
      restricted sample space of the outcomes where one event has already occurred.

     @ Probability formulae
     There is a formula you can use for two events that links the probability of the union and the
      probability of the intersection.




                                                                      :—
      Let P(A) = aand P(B) =b.




      Since i= P(4 M B) you can write the following addition formula for two events 4 and B:

      = P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AN B)
     f


     Example               ES (EES       CRITICAL THINKING

     A and B are two events, with P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = 0.7 and P(A U B) = 0.9

     Find P(A 1 B).                                 Watch out




        P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
                             - P(A 2 B)
       So P(A 1 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A UB)
                     =06+07-09

                     =04




     You can also use a Venn diagram in the explanation above to find a formula for P(B | A):

                                     &
         As                    B

         Since P(BM A) =i and P(A) =a, you can write the following multiplication formula for conditional
         probability for two events A and B:

                        P(BNM A)
         = P(B| A) =                  , 80 P(BM A) = P(B| A) x P(A)

                 1 A Venn diagram can be used to represent events graphically. Frequencies or probabilities
                     can be placed in the regions of the Venn diagram.

                 2 For mutually exclusive events, P(4 or B) = P(A) + P(B)

                 3 For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

                 4 A tree diagram can be used to show the outcomes of two (or more) events happening
                     in succession.

                 5 The event (4 and B) can be written as 4 M B. The ‘N’ symbol is the symbol for intersection.
                     The event (4 or B) can be written as A U B. The ‘U’ symbol is the symbol for union.
                     The event (not A) can be written as A’. This is also called the complementof             4.

                 6 The probability that B occurs given that A has already occurred is written as P(B|A).
                     For independent events, P(A|B) = P(4|B’) = P(A), and P(B|A) = P(BIA’) = P(B).

                 7 Addition rule:
                     P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) — P(A        B)

The two different variables in a set of bivariate
 data are often related.

              Correlation describes the nature of the linear relationship between two variables.

 For negatively correlated variables, when one variable increases
 the other decreases.

 For positively correlated variables, when one variable increases,
 the other also increases.

 = An independent (or explanatory) variable is one that is
              set independently of the other variable. It is plotted along
              the x-axis.

 = A dependent (or response) variable is one whose values are determined by the values of the
              independent variable. It is plotted along the y-axis.

         Two variables have a causal relationship if a change in one variable causes a change in the other.
         Just because two variables show correlation does not necessarily mean there is a causal relationship.

       5.3 ] Calculating least squares linear regression
         When you are analysing bivariate data, you can
         use a least squares regression line to predict
         values of the dependent (response) variable for
         given values of the independent (explanatory)
         variable. If the response variable isy and the
         explanatory variable is x, you should use the
         regression line of
                          y on x, which can be written
         in the form   y=a+bx

         The least squares regression line is the line that minimises the sum of the squares of the residuals
         of each data point.

 SKILL!    A doctor recorded the length of time taken, y minutes, to travel to work when leaving
Epcot:     home x minutes after 08:00, on seven randomly selected mornings. He then drew a
           scatter diagram to investigate a correlation. The linear regression line for his scatter
           diagram was y = 18.5 + 0.546x

           The doctor needs to arrive at work no later than 09:40. The number of minutes the
           doctor arrives early to work, when leaving home x minutes after 07:00, is denoted 2.
           Show that z = (100 - a) - (1 + 5)x and hence estimate, to the nearest minute, the latest
           time that the doctor can leave home without arriving late to work.




          Sometimes the original data are coded to make it easier  to manage. You can calculate the equation of
          the original regression line from the coded one by substituting the coding formula into the equation

      Previously, you used the summary statistics S,,, S,, and S,, to calculate the coefficients of a
      regression line equation. You can also use these summary statistics to calculate the product
      moment correlation coefficient.

      = The product moment correlation coefficient, r,

      Sometimes the original data are coded to make it easier to manage. Coding affects different statistics
      in different ways. As long as the coding is linear, the product moment correlation coefficient will be
      unaffected by the coding.
                                                                                 a

         You can think of linear coding as a change in scale on the axes of a scatter diagram.




         It is important to understand the limitations of the PMCC. You can determine the strength of the
         linear relationship between the variables by looking at the value of the PMCC




         = Values of r between 1 and 0 indicate a greater or lesser degree of positive correlation.
           The closer to 1 the better the correlation, the closer to 0 the worse the correlation.
         = Values of r between —1 and 0 indicate a greater or lesser degree of negative correlation.
           The closer to —1 the better the correlation, the closer to 0 the worse the correlation.

         Even if two variables are associated and have a linear correlation, it does not necessarily mean that a
         change in one of the variables causes a change in the other variable.

         For example, just because of the number of cars on the road has increased and the number of TVs
         bought has decreased, it does not mean there is a correlation between these two variables. A certain
         amount of critical thought is required when answering these types of questions.

                An independent (or explanatory) variable is one that is set independently of the other
                variable. It is plotted along the x-axis.

                A dependent (or response) variable is one whose values are determined by the values of
                the independent variable. It is plotted along the y-axis.

                The equation of the regression line of
                                                     y on x is:

                Coding of the regression line is sometimes used to simplify calculations. To turn a coded
                regression line into an actual regression line you substitute the codes into the answer.

                Interpolation is estimating the value of a dependent variable within the range of the data.

                Extrapolation is estimating a value outside the range of data. Values estimated by
                extrapolation can be unreliable.

       @® Discrete random variables
         Arandom variable is a variable whose value
         depends on the outcome of a random event.
                                                                       { Notation ) Random variables are written using

               can take is called its sample space.
                                                                           can take are written using equivalent lower case

           e The variable is random if the outcome is not known until the experiment is carried out.

         = A probability distribution fully describes the probability of any outcome in the sample space.

        The probability distribution for a discrete random variable can be described in a number of different
        ways. For example, take the random variable X = ‘score when a fair dice is rolled’. It can be described:

        All of these representations show the probability that the random variable takes any given value in its
        sample space. When all of the probabilities are the same, as in this example, the distribution is known
        as a discrete uniform distribution.

         not have to be a value that the random variable can actually take. Instead this tells us that in the long
         run, we would expect the average of all rolls to get close to 3.5.

       @ Variance of a discrete random variable

                                                       é                                         The variance is
        you can find the variance of those observations. As the number
                                                                                     sometimes denoted by o?, where
        of observations increases, this value will get closer and closer to
                                                                                     ais the standard deviation.
        the variance of the discrete random variable.

        = The variance of X is usually written as Var(X)
          and is defined as Var(X) = E((X
                                        - E(X))?)

        The random variable (X — E(X))* is the squared deviation from the expected value of X.
        It is large when X
                         takes values that are very different to E(X).

        = Sometimes it is easier to calculate the variance using
          the formula Var(X) = E(X2) - (E(X))*

        From the definition you can see that Var(X) = 0 for any random variable X. The variance of a discrete
        random variable is a measure of spread for a distribution ofa random variable that determines the
        degree to which the values of a random variable differ from the expected value. In other words, the
        larger the value of Var(X), the more likely it is to take values significantly different to its expected value.

        A   fair six-sided dice is rolled. The number on the uppermost face
         is modelled by the random variable XY.

         Find Var(X)


            Method 1

            We have that E(X) = 3.5

            The distributions of X, X? and (X
                                            — E(X))? are given by

             (x -— E(X))? | 6.25 | 2.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 2.25 | 6.25

             rpx=9          |e        lelelelélé
            So the variance is

            Var(X) = (x -— E(X))? P(X = x)




                                                                                    ||
                       = 6.25 x 242.25 x2+025 x

                       = (6.25 +2254+025)xi=%

            Method 2

            The expected value of X? is

            E(X2) = Dx?@P(X=axaZl+4+...436)                           22
            So using the alternative formula

   @ Expected value and variance of a function of X
     If X is a discrete random variable, and g is a function, then g(X) is also a discrete random variable.
    You can calculate the expected value of g(X) using the formula:

     = E(g(X)) = Dog (x)P(X = x)
    This is a more general version of the formula for E(X2). For simple functions, such as addition and
     multiplication by a constant, you can learn the following rules:

     = If Xis a random variable and a and dare constants, then E(aX

      This is an example of a discrete uniform distribution over the set of values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). It is discrete
      because the values are discrete and it is uniform because all the probabilities are the same.

      = Conditions for discrete uniform distribution:
         A discrete random variable Y is defined over a set of x distinct values.

         Each value is equally likely, in other words: P(X

      = In many cases, X is defined over the set (1, 2,3 ... 2). In such cases, the mean and variance are
         given by the following:

    functions for X to get the answers. You could also get the answers by writing down the probability
    distribution and finding the mean and variance without any previous working out. This is an
    acceptable alternative for the examination, although a longer and more time-consuming method.

           that a continuous random variable takes any one specific value is 0, but you can write the probability
           that it takes values within a given range. For example, when ten coins are flipped:

       The continuous variables generally encountered in real life are more likely to take values grouped
       around a central value than to take extreme values. The normal distribution is a continuous
        probability distribution that can be used to model many naturally occurring characteristics that
        behave in this way. Examples of continuous variables that can be modelled using the normal
       distribution are:
                                         heights of people within a given population

       @®D Using tables to find probabilities of the standard normal distribution Z
         TM Tables are provided in this textbook and the exam to help you calculate probabilities for the
            standard normal distribution, Z.
         = The standard normal variable is usually denoted by Z and has a mean of 0 and a standard
            deviation of 1. The common way of writing this is:


                                                         Z~N(0, 1’)

         The total area under the curve = 1. (The sum ofprobabilities in a probability distribution always add up
         to 1). Thus, P(Z < a) will just be the area under of the curve to the left of a.

         You can use tables or calculators to find these probabilities. Normal distribution tables are found in the
         back of the book and will be provided in the Mathematical Formulae and Statistical Tables book in the
         exam. The tables give P(Z < z) for different values of z.

         For a continuous distribution, such as the normal distribution, there is no difference between P(Z < z)
         and P(Z < z).

        @ The standard normal distribution
         It is often useful to standardise normally distributed random variables. You do this by coding the
         data so that it can be modelled by the standard normal distribution.

         = The standard normal distribution has mean 0 and                        { Notation } The standard normal
             standard deviation 1.                                                    variable is written as Z ~ N(O, 12)

         If X ~ N(, 0?) is a normal random
         variable with mean ju and standard           { Hint ) \f X =x then the corresponding value of Z will be
         deviation o, then you can code ¥                   & =tSt The mean of the coded data will be HH - Oand
         using the formula:
                                                            the standard deviation will be Z =1
                      X-p
                 Z=
                       o


         The resulting z-values will be normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

         For the standard normal curve Z ~ N(@, 1%), the probability P(Z < a) is sometimes written as ®(a).
         You can find it by entering jz = 0 and o = 1 into the normal cumulative distribution function on your
         calculator, or by using the tables.

        Use of calculators

        You may be able to find probabilities for a normal distribution using your calculator.

        You will need to refer to the instructions for your particular calculator.

        These calculators can be used in your $1 examination but you are advised to clearly state the
        probability you are finding and give your final answer to 3 significant figures.

        For example, P(¥
                       < 53) = 0.5 + 0.27337... = 0.77337... = 0.773 (3 sf)

            Summary of key points

             1 Total area under the normal distribution curve = 1

             2 The normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical, and therefore:

                      P(Z <0) =0.5

                      P(Z>0)=0.5

             3 P(Z <a) is denoted by O(a)
             4 You can use symmetry properties to find the probability fora <0

                      P(Z <-a) =1-P(Z<a)

                      P(Z > -a) = P(Z < a)




                  AREA = P(Z<a)|     | AREA= P(Z >a)
                                           =1-P(Z<a)
