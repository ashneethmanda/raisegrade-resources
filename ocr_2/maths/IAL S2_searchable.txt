(1.1) The binomial distribution
 Consider a biased dice whose probability of rolling a 6 is equal to p.
 You are going to roll the dice 4 times and count how many times you roll a 6.

 The number of 6s that you roll is a discrete random variable. We can define it as:
         Let ¥ represent the number of 6s rolled when we roll a dice 4 times.
 There are a few observations we can make:
   © There are a fixed number oftrials - we roll the dice 4 times

      There are two outcomes - rolling a 6 and not rolling a 6
   @ The trials are independent - each trial has no effect on future trials

   © The probability of rolling a 6 is constant.

 Situations like this can be modelled using a tree diagram to represent the possible outcomes.

 Let the probability of rolling   a6 =p

 Let the probability of rolling (not a six) = g, where
                                                     p + q=1

We can model a situation using the binomial distribution by making use of the assumptions of the
binomial.
Consider selecting sweets from a bag without replacing what is taken. The bag contains a large
number of strawberry-flavoured sweets and a large number of apple-flavoured sweets. We are also
told that the sweets are in the ratio 3: 1.
The probabilities will be affected each time a sweet is taken because they are not being replaced.
However, the large number of sweets means that the probabilities will be small enough to be able
to assume that the probability of success is constant.




A bag contains a large number of strawberry-flavoured and apple-flavoured sweets in the ratio 1 : 4.
5 sweets are chosen at random without replacement.
a What assumptions need to be made to use the binomial distribution?
b With this assumption, find the probability that at least 4 of the sweets
  chosen are strawberry-flavoured.

     @Q The Poisson distribution
      In the binomial expansion, there are a fixed number of trials with only two possible outcomes for
      each trial ~ success and failure. We count the number of successes.
      Let us consider a different situation.

      A small company is looking at how many complaints it receives by telephone each day.
      The company has just one phone line. Data is collected over 100 days, as shown in this table:

       Number
            of
                             ofif2}3}4}]s}oe6]7]s8]
                                             9] 0} a]
      calls
        per day
       Frequency | 4 | 17 | 25[ 23 | 18/0 [2[o0f[o0]ofo]fof]f4

      The phone calls:
            =   occur singly in time - only one phone call occurs at any given time

           = are random

            = occur independently in a given timeframe.
      There are 6 or fewer calls per day, except one day when there were 12. In theory, the maximum
      number of calls could be infinite, but numbers much bigger than the mean are not anticipated.

      We analyse these data further by calculating the mean and variance.
      For these data, ¥fx = 282, ¥ fx? = 1078 and n = 100

      The mean number of calls per day is therefore ~* = 282. 2.52
                   tance      te Ee          1078
      And the variance is “A —           32-1078 _ 2.922    2.8276

      Here, the mean and variance are very close in value.

      In this situation, the data can be modelled by a Poisson distribution.

      For a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are assumed to be the same and so there is only
      one parameter, the rate at which the calls are made per day. This is equivalent to the mean and is
      represented by A.

      ® Letting X ~ Po(2), the Poisson distribution is given by:

                P(X= x)=             , where
                                         x =0,1,2,...
                                at

      We can confirm this by looking at the data above:

         To show that this is a probability distribution, [P(X = x) = 1, consider each term:
              EP(X
                = x) = P(X =0) + P(X'= 1) + P(X=2) +P(X=3) +...

       { 2.2) Modelling with the Poisson distribution
         You need to be able to recognise situations that can be modelled with a Poisson distribution.
         The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of times, X, that a particular event
         occurs within a given interval of time or space.

The parameter 2 in the Poisson distribution is the average number of times that the event will
occur in a single interval.

Examples of where a Poisson distribution might be appropriate are:
           the number of radioactive particles being emitted (sent out) by a certain
           source in a 5-minute period
           the number of telephone calls to a switchboard in a 10-minute interval
           the number of spelling mistakes on a page of a newspaper

           the number of cars passing the front of a school in a 3-minute interval

           the number of raisins in a fruitcake.

Generally, the larger the value of     and the smaller the value of p, the better the approximation will be.
In this situation, (1 — p) will be close to 1, so Var(X) = np(1 — p) will be close to the mean of the
distribution, E(X) = np. This satisfies the condition for a Poisson distribution model that the mean
and variance are close.

In general, a question will state when you need to use an approximation.

A binomial distribution can be
approximated by a Poisson distribution
and sometimes it can be approximated by               Discrete

a normal distribution.

If you are approximating a binomial
distribution to a normal distribution,
you should always go directly to the            Ea
normal distribution and not via a Poisson                   |
distribution. This is because the binomial to
normal approximation involves one not two
approximations and should therefore be             [Posen]
more accurate.

a helpful guide is to calculate the mean np. If this is less than or equal to 10, you should be able to
use the Poisson tables, so that approximation can be used. If the mean is more than 10, then a
normal approximation is usually suitable.

The probability that a continuous random variable takes any one specific value is 0.
However, you can write the probability that it takes values within a given range.

To describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, you usually give a table of
values to define the probability of the random variable taking each value in its sample space.

Because the probability of a continuous random variable taking a specific value is 0, you cannot
define its distribution in this way. Instead, you can use a probability density function (p.d.f.) to
define the probability of the random variable taking values within a given range.

In practice, probability density functons are often non-zero on a limited subset of the real numbers.

       @ Mode, median, quartiles and percentiles
         You need to be able to find the mode of a continuous random variable.

         = The mode of a continuous random variable is the value of x for which the p.d.f. is a maximum.
         This is the value of x for which the probability distribution is ‘most dense’. A random variable can have
         more than one modal value, though you will usually only be asked to find the mode in cases where
         the probability density function has a unique maximum value.

             1 For each of the following sets of conditions, sketch the probability density function of
               adistribution which satisfies all the conditions:
               a the distribution is symmetrical, but mode= median
               b there is a unique mode which lies outside the interquartile range.

             2 By fully specifyinga suitable pdf, give an example ofa non-symmetrical distribution
                in which the median and the mode are equal.

       @® Modelling with the continuous uniform distribution
         The continuous uniform distribution is frequently used to model real-life situations. For example,
         if you know that trains leave from a station hourly, but you arrive not knowing when the next train
         will leave, then the length of time you have to wait after arriving at the station, X minutes, could be
         modelled as V ~ U(0, 60).




         The trunk of a small tree varies in diameter from 10cm at the bottom to 2cm at the top.
         The tree is cut horizontally at a randomly chosen point, and the radius Rem of the
         cross-section is modelled as R ~ U[1, 5].
         Find the expected value of the area, A, of the cross-section of the tree.

       @ Populations and samples
         © In statistics, a population is the whole set of items that are of interest.
         For example, the population could be the items manufactured by a factory or all the people in a town.
         Information can be obtained from a population. This is known as raw data.

         ®TM Acensus observes or measures every member of a population.
         TM A sample is a selection of observations taken from a subset of the population which is used to
              find out information about the population as a whole.

         There are a number of advantages and disadvantages of both a census and a sample.

                                          Advantages                                        Disadvantages

                                                                                 process destroys the item
                                                                            +    Hard to process a large quantity of data
             ‘Sample    |-   Less time-consuming and expensive than         |+   The data may not be as accurate
                             acensus                                        + The sample may not be large enough
                        +    Fewer people needed to respond                      to give information about small sub-
                        +    Less data to process than in a census               groups of the population

         The size of a sample can affect the validity of any conclusions drawn.
         +    The size of the sample depends on the required accuracy and available resources.
         +    Generally, the larger the sample, the more accurate it is, but you will need greater resources.
         +    If the population is very varied, you need a larger sample than if the population were uniform.
         +    Different samples can lead to different conclusions due to the natural variation in a population.

         ® Individual units of a population are known as sampling units.

         ® Often, sampling units of a population are individually named or numbered to forma                  list called
              a sampling frame.




         A supermarket wants to test a delivery of plums for ripeness by cutting them in half,
         a Suggest a reason why the supermarket should not test all the plums in the delivery.

         ‘The supermarket tests a sample of S plums and finds that 4 of them are ripe.
         They estimate that 80% of the plums in the delivery are ripe.

         b Suggest one way that the supermarket could improve their estimate.


             a   Testing all the plums would mean that
                 there were none left to sell

             b   Testing a larger sample (30 plums, for

                 example) would give a better estimate of                                                nets ave

         b Give one advantage and one disadvantage to the school of using a census.

       2A factory makes safety ropes for climbers and has an order to supply 3000 ropes. The buyer
         wants to know if the load at which the ropes break is more than a certain figure.
         a Suggest a reason why a census would not be used for this purpose.
         The factory tests four ropes and the load for breaking is recorded for each rope:
                         320kg       260kg   «= M0kg =       «180k

      @ The concept of a statistic

       is called a population parameter. A parameter is              CEE we ate oar ree
       Any characteristic of a population which is measurable                Notation


       a numerical property of a sample. For example, the
       population mean and the population variance are
       population parameters.
SAMPLING AND SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS                           CHAPTER 6                                                105




         Usually the population is too large to calculate
         these parameters. In order to estimate a population
         parameter, we take a random sample from the
         population and use observations from the items in
         it to estimate the required parameters. For example,


                                                                   { Notation ) ‘We use upper case lettersto
         we could use the sample mean as an estimate for
         the popultion mean
                                                                          resent a distribution.
         © Astatistic is a quantity calculated only from              ye vee to denote an observation from the
              the observations in a sample. It does not                distribution X.
              involve any unknown parameters. Thus, a
              statistic is a numerical property of a sample.

                                 <p:                                  dw, - XF

        ©) Tre sampling distribution of a statistic
         If we repeatedly take samples from a population and calculate the same statistic each time, there is a
         range of values that the statistic can take. The statistic will have its own distribution which we call the
         sampling distribution.

         ® The sampling distribution of a statistic gives all the values of a statistic and the probability that
              each would happen by chance alone.




         A school would          like to introduce a school uniform, and thus wants to find out how much support
         this idea has among the students at the school. The random variable Y is defined as:

                          1    if the student supports the idea
                  x=                   "

         A hypothesis is a statement made about the value of a                              z                        *

         calculated from the sample is called the test statistic.                           # Statistics2 Section 1.1
         In order to carry out the test, you need to form two hypotheses:

         = The null hypothesis Ho is the hypothesis that you                 CEEDD inthis section, you

         a Describe the test statistic.
         b Write down a suitable null hypothesis.

         ¢ Write down a suitable alternative hypothesis.


          a   The test statistic is X, the number of

              heads in 6 tosses.

          b   If the coin is unbiased, the probability of
              it landing on heads is 0.5    so

              Ho:   p = 0.5 is the null hypot!   sis.



              If the coin is bi    d in favour of landing on

              heads then the probability of landing on
              heads will be greater than 0.5

              Hx:   p > 0.5 is the alternative hypothesis.



         = Hypothesis tests with alternative hypotheses in the form H,: p<... and H,: p >... are called
           ‘one-tailed tests.

           two-tailed tests.

         To carry out a hypothesis test, you assume the null hypothesis is true. You then consider how
         likely it was for the observed value ofthe test statistic to occur. If this likelihood is less than a
         given threshold (called the significance level of the test) then you reject the null hypothesis.

         Typically the significance level for a hypothesis test will be 10%, 5% or 1%, but you will be told
         which level to use in the question.

                    experience, to be 0.1. A sample of 100 articles from a new manufacturing process is tested,
                    and 8 are found to be faulty. The manufacturers wish to test, at the 5% level of significance,
                     whether or not there has been a reduction in the proportion of faulty articles.

                                  jing critical values

           When you carry out a hypothesis test, you need to be able to calculate the probability of the test
           statistic taking particular values, given that the null hypothesis is true.

           In this chapter you will assume that the test statistic can be modelled by a binomial distribution.
           You will use this to calculate probabilities and find critical regions.

                              ical region is a region of the probability distribution which, if the test statistic falls
                             in it, would cause you to reject the null hypothesis.

           Atest statistic is modelled as B(10, p) and a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level uses
           Hg: p = 0.4, H,: p > 0.4. Assuming H, to be true, X has the following distribution: X ~ B(10, 0.4)

      = The critical value is the first value to fall inside of the critical region.
      In this example, the critical value is 8 and the critical region is 8, 9 or 10.
      7 falls in the acceptance region, the region where we accept the null hypothesis.
      The critical value and hence the critical region can be determined from binomial distribution
      tables, or by finding cumulative binomial probabilities using your calculator.
      In the 1 = 10 table, the critical region is found by looking for a probability such that P(Y > x) < 0.05

      This shows that x = 7 is not extreme enough to lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis
      but that x = 8 is. Hence x = 8 is the critical value and x > 8 is the critical region.

        @ Two-tailed tests
         In section 7.3, all of the hypothesis tests were testing whether the proportion had gone up or had
         gone down. There is a direction to Hy.

         Sometimes we may be asked if it has changed. We are not told how it has changed and so there is.
         no direction to H;. This is called a two-tailed test.

         = For a two-tailed test, halve the significance level at the end you are testing.
         You need to know which tail of the distribution you are testing. If the test statistic is ¥ ~ B(n, p)
         then the expected outcome is mp. If the observed value x is lower than this then consider
         P(X < x). If the observed value is higher than the expected value, then consider P(X > x).
         In your exam it will usually be obvious which tail you should test.

          9 Anestate agent usually sells apartments at a rate of 10 per week. Over an eight-week period
               during a recession (when money was less available) he sold 55 apartments.

               Using a suitable approximation, test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is
               evidence that the weekly rate of sales was reduced by the recession.

               He chooses 100 workers at random and finds that in the last month, two employees had
               been absent for at least one day.

               Using a suitable approximation, test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not this provides
               evidence that the percentage of workers who are absent for at least | day per month is less than 20%.




          1    Mai travels to work five days a week on a train. She does two journeys per day.
               Over a long period of time, she finds that the train is late 20% of the time.
               A new company takes over the train service that Mai uses. Mai thinks that the service
               will be late more often. In the first week of the new service the train is late three times.
               You may assume that the number of times the train is late in a week has a binomial distribution.
               Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is evidence that there is an increase in
               the number of times the train is late. State your hypothesis clearly.                          (7 marks)

            A company that makes medicines claims that 85% of patients suffering from
            a severe rash (red spots on the skin) recover when treated with a new skin cream.

            A random sample of 20 patients with this rash is taken from hospital records.

12 A   large caravan company hires caravans out for a week at a time. During the winter, the mean
    number of caravans hired is 6 per week.

   a Calculate the probability that in one particular week in winter, the company will hire out
       exactly 4 caravans.
   The company decides to reduce prices in winter and do extra advertising. This results in the
   mean number of caravans being hired out rising to 11 per week.
   b Test, at the 5% significance level, whether or not the proportion of caravans hired out has
       increased. State your hypothesis clearly.


13 At one stage of a water treatment process, the number of particles of dirt per litre present in
   the water has a Poisson distribution with mean 10. The water then enters a filter (something
   you pass a liquid through to remove particular substances) which should extract 75% of dirt.
   ‘The manager of the water treatment facility orders
                                                     a study into the effectiveness of this filter.
   Twenty I-litre samples are taken from the water and 64 particles
                                                                 of foreign matter are found.

    Using a suitable approximation, test, at the 5% level of significance, whether or not there is
   evidence that the filter is failing to work properly.


14 A shop finds that it sells jars of onion marmalade at the rate of 10 per week.
    During a television cookery programme, onion marmalade is used in a recipe.
   ‘Over the next six weeks the shop sells 84 jars of onion marmalade.

    Using a suitable approximation, test, at the 5%   level of significance, whether or not there is
   evidence that the rate of sales after the television programme has increased as a result of the
   recipe in the cookery programme.


18 A manufacturer produces large quantities of patterned plates. It is known from previous
   records that 6% of the plates will be rejected because of flaws in the pattern. To check that the
   production process is not getting worse, the manager takes a sample of 150 plates and finds
   that 15 have flaws in their pattern.

    Use a suitable approximation to test, at the 5% significance level, whether or not the process is
   getting worse.


16 Julia grows apples. Over a period of time, she finds that the probability of an apple being below the

   variety of apple. A sample of 200 of this other variety of apple had 60 rejected as being undersized,

    Use a suitable approximation to test, at the 5% significance level, whether or not the new
   variety of apple is better than the old variety of apple.

           1 The null hypothesis H, is the hypothesis that we assume to be correct.

           2   The alternative hypothesis H, tells us about the parameter if our assumption
               is shown to be wrong.

           3   Hypothesis tests with alternative hypotheses in the form H,:0<... and Hy: @>...
               are called one-tailed tests, where 6 is the parameter from the distribution.

           4 Hypothesis tests with an alternative hypothesis in the form Hy: 0 #
               are called two-tailed tests, where @ is the parameter from the distribution.

           5   Acritical region is a region of the probability distribution which, if the test statistic
               falls within it, would cause you to reject the null hypothesis.

           6 The critical value is the first value to fall inside of the critical region.

           7 The actual significance level of a hypothesis test is the probability
               of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.

           8   Fora two-tailed test, the critical region is split at either end of the distribution.

           9 Fora two-tailed test, halve the significance level at each end you are testing.
