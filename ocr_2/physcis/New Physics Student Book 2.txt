Exam Practice
Exam-style questions at the end of
each chapter are tailored to the Pearson
Edexcel specification to allow for practice
and development of exam writing
technique. They also allow for practice
responding to the “command words” used
in the exams (see the command words
glossary at the back of this book).

The Preparing for your exams section
at the end of the book includes sample
answers for different question types,
with comments about the strengths and                     ttt
weaknesses of the answers.
PRACTICAL SKILLS
Practical work is central to the study of physics. The second year of the Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Level
(IAL) Physics course includes eight Core Practicals that link theoretical knowledge and understanding to practical
scenarios.

Your knowledge and understanding of practical skills and activities will be assessed in all exam papers for the
IAL Physics qualification.

e    Papers 4 and 5 will include questions based on practical activities, including novel scenarios.

e    Paper 6 will test your ability to plan practical work, including risk management and selection of apparatus.

In order to develop practical skills, you should carry out a range of practical experiments related to the topics covered in
your course. Further suggestions in addition to the Core Practicals are included below.

      Acceleration can be considered as a change in momentum per unit mass. It can often be more exciting
                                                                                                        tl
      basic calculations such as calculating the changing speed of a car.

      Curling is a game which originated in Scotland. It is now an established sport which is popular in Canada and
  Japan. The sport uses the ideas of conservation of momentum and elastic collisions. Players deliberately collide
  the stones to deflect their opponents’ stones, and to ensure their own stone finishes in a winning position. Also,
  the friction with the ice causes a change in momentum to slow the stone to a stop.

      In this chapter, you will learn about the way forces can    change the momentum of an object over time.   The
      chapter will also cover how kinetic energy changes in different types of collisions, whilst momentum is
      conserved. All of this will be extended to events happening in two dimensions, so vector addition and the
      resolving of vectors will be revisited in order to make the necessary calculations.

                                     DEEP SPACE COLLISION

                                     On 4 July 2005, NASA's Deep Impact mission succeeded in crashing a spacecraft into a comet
                                     called Tempel 1 (fig E). For that mission, the impactor spacecraft had a mass of 370 kg compared
                                     with the comet's mass of 7.2 x 10'%kg, so there would have been an insignificant change in the
                                     comet’s trajectory. Deep Impact was purely intended to study the comet’s composition. However,
                                     there is an asteroid named Apophis which has a small chance of colliding with Earth in 2035, 2036,
                                     or maybe 2037, and there have been some calls for a mission to crash a spacecraft into Apophis in
                                     order to move it out of the crash line. The mass of this asteroid is 6.1 x 10!° kg and it is travelling
                                     at 12.6kms"'. It has been claimed that a collision by a 4000 kg impactor craft travelling at 6kms“!
A.       fig E The comet Tempel 1
                                     could change the path of this asteroid enough to ensure it would not hit Earth. If this impactor
         was hit by NASAs Deep
         Impact probe.               collided with Apophis at right angles, we can calculate the change in angle of the asteroid (fig F).

                                     The momentum of the combined object after the impactor embeds in the asteroid is the vector sum
                                     of the two initial momenta, which are at right angles to each other.

                                     After collision:

                                                    = 7.69 x 10"#kgms"

                                     There is no significant change in the magnitude of the asteroid’s velocity. Is there a significant change
                                     in its direction?

                                     Angle of momentum after:

                                     Although less than two microdegrees sounds like an insignificantly small angle, this would represent
                                     a change in position of nearly 30 km as Apophis crosses the Earth’s orbit from one side of the Sun
                                     to the other. This might be just enough to prevent a collision with Earth that would have a hundred
                                     times more energy than all the explosives used in the Second World War.

                                      Archer fish catch insect prey by squirting water droplets into the air to knock the insects off leaves
                                       above the surface.

                                       Calculations of the mass and velocity of the water droplet, and its impact time, show that the impact
                                      force can be ten times stronger than the insect's grip on the leaf.

The poster was produced by the Planetary Society. It aims to explain the issues connected with
a possible asteroid collision with the Earth.
1   (a) Discuss the tone and level of vocabulary and level of scientific detail in the poster. Who is
       the intended audience?                                                                            INTERPRETATION NOTE

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics elsewhere
in this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out
the answers.
3 (a) Look at section 1. Find in the poster. What is a NEO?
    (b) Explain two of the difficulties in finding NEOs.
4 Consider an asteroid 1000km in diameter, with a structure of iron and rock. The overall
    density of such asteroids is about    2000kgm-?.
    (a) Estimate the volume of the asteroid. Why is your answer an estimate and not the exact
       answer?

    (b) Calculate an estimate for its mass.
    (c) Imagine the asteroid travelled directly towards the Earth at 10 000ms"! and collided and
       embedded into the surface of the Earth. Calculate the change in speed of the Earth. The
        mass of the Earth is 5.97 x 10%kg.
5 A Planetary Society scientist suggests we try to blow the asteroid apart with a nuclear
    explosion (as in 4. Deflect) before it hits the Earth. If the bomb can be set off 24 hours before    Think about what would

          5B                  CIRCULAR MOTION
     What is it that makes the swing carousel so much fun? How do the engineers who build it have confidence that it
     will operate safely? The motion of objects in circles is very common in everyday life. We see the Moon orbiting
     the Earth, and the Earth orbiting the Sun, whilst the Earth itself is making us rotate in a circle every day. The
     mathematics of the forces causing this motion is simple, but applying this to real-life situations, like the amount
     of tension in the chains of a swing carousel, can often leave people feeling confused.

     In this chapter, we will learn how simple trigonometry and basic mechanics can generate the mathematics that
     we need to be able to analyse and predict the circular motions of many things. This includes things from
     subatomic particles being accelerated in the Large Hadron Collider, to the routing of a spacecraft travelling to
     Mars. Indeed, very simple circular motion calculations on entire galaxies led scientists to the idea that there must
     be dark matter throughout the Universe.

In our study of wave phase in Book 1, Section 3B.1, we learned
how angles can be measured in radians as well as in degrees, and
how to convert between these two units. In this section, we will see
how we can extend that to measure movements around a circle.


GOING ROUND IN CIRCLES
For an object moving in a circle, we often need to measure where
it is around that circle. For example, to consider the relative
positions of planets in their orbits at a particular time, we need to
be able to state where each one is (ignoring, in this example, the
fact that planetary orbits are not perfect circles!).

Angles measured in degrees are used extensively in navigation to
locate places. We also use them to describe the difference between
moving from one starting point to two possible destinations. This
is measuring angular displacement on the surface of the Earth.
Each degree is subdivided into 60 ‘arcminutes’ and each of those
arcminutes into 60 ‘arcseconds’.                                        A. fig

     A The instantaneous velocity of an object moving in a circle is ta ential to the circle. When there is no resultant
    force, velocity will be           so it moves in a straight   line, as this hammer will do w!   n the athlete lets go.

The hammer is moved in a circle at a constant speed and so the magnitude of the velocity is always
the same. However, the direction of the velocity is constantly changing. This means that the vector
of velocity is constantly changing, and a change in velocity is an acceleration. Newton's first law tells
us that acceleration will only happen if there is a resultant force. The hammer is constantly being
pulled towards the centre of the circle. In this example, the force providing this pull is the tension in
the string (or chain). For any object moving in a circle, there must be a resultant force to cause this
acceleration, and it is called the centripetal force.

A centrifuge is a machine for
spinning things. There is no
‘centrifugal’ force - do not use
the phrase ‘centrifugal force’.

Without a centripetal force
acting, Newton's 1st law will
make an object continue in a
straight line. This can confuse
people into thinking that a force
is pushing an object outwards.
In fact, this shows a lack of
force; if a force were present,                                                       ai)

                                          Estimate the centripetal force on an astronaut in the astronaut training centrifuge (see fig B) if his
                                         capsule rotated once every 2 seconds.

                                          Estimate of radius of revolution: r= 6m.

                                          Estimate of astronaut's mass: m = 80kg.

                                         This is about 6 times his weight.

                                         the astronauts angular velocity, centripetal force and acceleration now be?

                                                                     = 6.28 rads"!

                                             centripetal acceleration, a = rw? = (6) x (6.28)? = 237             ms2

                                         This is about 24 times the acceleration due to gravity and would probably kill the astronaut after a
                                         few seconds.

A.   fig Experimental detail for centripetal force experiment

You can investigate the centripetal force equation by spinning a rubber bung on a string around in a circle.
The tension in the string, which is the centripetal force, will be provided by the hanging masses at the
bottom ofthe vertical string and will be known. Spin the rubber bung around in a circle at a speed that
keeps a paperclip marker in a constant position near the handle. The paperclip marker allows you to
maintain a fixed length of string (radius) which you can measure. You will also need to measure the mass of
the rubber bung. Your partner can then time ten revolutions in order to give you the angular velocity. Take
angular velocity measurements for different forces (different numbers of hanging masses).

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics elsewhere
in this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out
the answers.

    (b) What would a ‘gravity gradient’ be? Explain how it would come about and why it would
        be minimised by maximising the radius.
3 (a) Convert the angular velocity in Gilruth’s data into SI units.
    (b) Calculate the centripetal force on an 82 kg astronaut using Gilruth’s data.
    (c) If this astronaut tried to walk by providing a tangential force of 350N, calculate the
        moment caused by his foot, acting on the floor about the spacecraft’s central axis.         PHYSICS TIP

CHAPTER




          6A                    ELECTRIC FIELDS
     The usual explanation for the spiky hair caused by touching a Van de Graaff generator is that the excess charges
     it puts on the body all repel each other, so each hair experiences a force pushing it away from the others and
     from the head. Whilst this is true, the explanation is too simple. The hair shows us the existence of an electric
     field coming from the person's head, with the hair trying to follow the electric field lines. Gravity also affects the
     hair, so there is a resultant force effect. If your school has a Van de Graaff generator, you could try setting up an
     experiment where the person in contact with it is in different positions (i.e. lying down on a wooden bench,
     bending over at the waist, etc.), so that the electrical and gravitational forces are not working against each other
     quite so much!

     In this chapter, we will see the difference between uniform and radial fields, and learn how to calculate the
     strength of both types of electric field. We will also explore the concept of electric potential, which relates to the
     storage and delivery of electrical energy.

       C The blue arrows show the direction ofthe uniform electric field produced between parallel plates that have a
     potential difference between them. The dashed lines show where the potential is constant along equipotential lines.

An electric field exists between any objects which are at different electrical potentials. So, if we
connect parallel metal plates to a power supply, we can set up a potential difference, and therefore an
electric field, between them. This is shown in fig C. The field is uniform if its field lines are parallel
across the whole field.

The strength of a uniform electric field is a measure of how rapidly it changes the potential over
distance. The equation which describes this divides the potential difference, V, by the distance over
which the potential difference exists, d:

A   figG Millkan’s oil drop chamber.


For Millikan’s oil drops, the density of air in the chamber is so low that its upthrust is generally
insignificant (although we would have to consider it if we wanted to do really accurate calculations).
Under terminal velocity, the weight equals the viscous drag force:
       Mg = 6TWVrerm!


where 1 is the viscosity of air, and ris the radius of the drop.

When held stationary by switching on the electric field and adjusting the potential, V, until the drop
stands still:
       weight = electric force

By eliminating the weight from the two situations, this means that:

Millikan could not measure rdirectly, so he had to eliminate it from the equations. Further development
of Stokes’ law tells us that a small drop falling at a low terminal velocity will follow the equation:

COMBINING ELECTRIC FIELDS
When there are electric fields caused by more than one charged
object, the overall field at any place is the vector sum of all
the contributions from each field. The force effects of each
contributing field combine to produce the overall field. At every
point you have to work out the resultant force and so you know
how a charged particle will be affected in that place. The sum of
all of these individual force effects is the overall electric field.

Charge is particularly concentrated in regions around spikes or
points on charged objects. This means that they have close field                          <

CHARGED PARTICLE INTERACTIONS
The attraction between a proton and an electron can be imagined as the proton creating an electric
field because of its positive charge, and the electron experiencing a force produced by the proton’s
field. (Note that it could also be thought of the other way round, with the proton experiencing a force
caused by the electron’s electric field.)

In 2010, a SOOKV high voltage transmission line was proposed to carry electricity for 28 miles across Washington State in the USA.
The Bonneville Power Administration commissioned various reports to investigate safety and other public interest issues related to the
new power lines, to inform local government officers. Dan Bracken, an independent scientific consultant, wrote a substantial report on
the impact of electric fields that might be generated by the power lines.

ELECTRIC FIELDS AND LIVING TISSUE
An electric field is said to exist in a region of space if an electrical
charge, at rest in that space, experiences a force of electrical origin
(ie. electric fields cause free charges to move). Electric field is
a vector quantity: that is,     it has both magnitude and direction.
The direction corresponds to the direction that a positive charge
would move in the field. Sources of electric fields are unbalanced
electrical charges (positive or negative) and time-varying magnetic
fields. Transmission lines, distribution lines, house wiring, and
appliances generate electric fields in their vicinity because of
the unbalanced electrical charges              associated with voltage on the
conductors. On the power system in North America, the voltage
and charge on the energized conductors are cyclic (plus to minus
to plus) at a rate of 60 times per second. This changing voltage
results in electric fields ns          urces that are also time-varying at
a frequency of 60 hertz (Hz; a frequency unit equivalent to cycles
per second).

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics elsewhere
in this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out
the answers.

      the other correct possibility of   NC-!?

      coming out of a long straight cable also be referred to as radial?                            The proposed 500 kV cable

The author has written that ‘close to transmission- or distribution-line conductors, the field
decreases rapidly with distance from the conductors.’ Imagine that the senators from
Washington State government have written a letter to ask for an explanation of this claim. Write
a letter in response which explains the mathematics involved in radial electric fields. Include
some example calculations to illustrate the values involved, for comparison with other values
already given in the report.

The touch screen on many smartphones works by measuring the capacitance of every point on a grid that covers
the screen. Your finger conducts electricity, so when you touch the screen it changes the capacitance at that
point. This is measured as a position on the grid of the screen so that the phone knows where you have touched
and can follow your touch instruction. Capacitor-based touch screens cannot detect the touch if you wear
non-conductive gloves, as the measurements are based on how well the points on the screen can store charge,
and how charge can escape when you touch it.

The touch screen is one of the more interesting applications of the capacitor. However, as they can store energy,
act as timing components, and smooth out varying currents, capacitors are found in almost all modern electronic
devices.

In this chapter, we will see how electric fields drive electric charge to be stored on a capacitor, and how this
simple process can lead to some complex but beautiful mathematics for the charge storage.

                                  If, in fig A, the capacitor is fully charged, it will be at 6 V, and from Q = CV we know it will be storing
                                  0.6 mC of charge. Recall that in Section 6B.1 we looked at how the electrons in the circuit are
                                  influenced by the electric field caused by the supply voltage, and their own mutual repulsion. If the
                                  two-way switch in fig A is moved to position B, the electrons on the capacitor will be able to move
                                  to the positive side of it by discharging via the lamp. As it has 100 Q resistance, their progress will be
                                  slowed by the lamp, but they will still discharge, and the lamp will light for as long as some current
                                  flows through it.

                                  At first, the rush of electrons as the capacitor discharges is as high as it can be — the current starts at
                                  a maximum. We can calculate this current using Ohm’s law — it is 0.06 A. After some electrons have
                                  discharged, the p.d. across the capacitor is reduced and the electric field, and therefore the push on
                                  the remaining electrons, is weaker. The current ) is less and the light will be dimmer.
                                  Some time later, the flow of electrons is so small that the current is down to a trickle, and the lamp
                                  will be so dim that it may look like it is off. Eventually, the capacitor will be fully discharged and there
                                  will be no more electrons moving from one side of the capacitor to the other — the current will be
                                  zero. If we put this story together over time, the discharging current, p.d. across the capacitor, and
                                  charge remaining on the capacitor will follow the patterns shown on the three graphs in fig B.

THE TIME CONSTANT
How could we make the lamp light up for longer, given the same power supply? There are two
possibilities:

1     store more charge on the capacitor

2     decrease the rate at which the capacitor discharges.

For the same maximum p.d., increasing the capacitance, C, will increase the charge stored, as Q = CV.
Alternatively, the charge would flow more slowly if the bulb’s resistance, R, was greater.

An overall impression of the rate of discharge of a capacitor can be gained by working out the
time constant, 7. This is calculated from 7 = RC, and with resistance in ohms and capacitance in
farads, the answer is in seconds. In fact, the time constant tells you how many seconds it takes for the
current to fall to 37% of its starting value. We will see the mathematics of how 37% comes about
in the next section, but for now we just need to understand that RC indicates how quickly a charged
capacitor will discharge.


 WORKED EXAMPLE 2
 What is the time constant for the capacitor in the circuit shown in fig A?

        7=RC=100x 100 x 10°

        7=0.01s

    So the light bulb shown in fig
                                 A might flash on and off so quickly that we could not see it!


CAR COURTESY LIGHTS
Modern cars often have a courtesy light that comes on when the door is opened, and remains on for
a short time after the door is closed. This is useful in case it is dark, allowing the driver to see to put
the key in the ignition. The light functions by having a capacitor discharge through the light bulb so
that it dims and goes off as the charge runs out. In some cars, the length of time for which the light
remains on after the door is closed is adjustable and can be set by the vehicle owner. This adjustable
setting makes use of the idea of the time constant, RC. The owner will be able to adjust a switch
connected to the courtesy light circuit, which connects more or less resistance to the discharging
circuit. So, for the same fully charged capacitor, the time taken to discharge completely will change
and the courtesy light illuminates the cabin for more or less time.

      equations.


DISCHARGING CAPACITOR MATHS
CHARGE, Q
We have seen that the charging and discharging of a capacitor follows curving graphs in which
the current is constantly changing. It follows that the rate of change of charge and pd. are also
constantly changing. These graphs are known as exponential curves. The shapes can be produced
by plotting mathematical formulae which have power functions in them. In the case of discharging a
capacitor, C, through a resistor, R, the function that describes the charge remaining on the capacitor,
Q, ata time, ¢ is:
       Q= Qe"
where Q, is the initial charge on the capacitor at ¢ = 0, and e is the special mathematical number
which is used in the inverse function of natural logarithms (e = 2.718).

      Q=0.17¢


VOLTAGE, V
The p.d. across a discharging capacitor will fall as the charge stored falls. By substituting the equation
Q=    CVinto our exponential decay equation, we can show the formula that describes voltage on a
discharging capacitor is in exactly the same form as for the charge itself:
       Q= Qe and Q= CV

(which also means that initially, Qg = CVo)
       CV = CVye

from which the capacitance term, C, can be cancelled, leaving:
       V= Voor

CURRENT, /
As we saw in Section 6B.2, the discharging current also dies away following an exponential curve.
Ohm’s law tells us that V= JR, and so Vo = hR.
       V= Ve


      IR = IpRe’®C

from which the resistance term, R, will cancel on both sides:
      T= [yevRe

 PRACTICAL SKILL
 Using a spreadsheet to investigate the time constant
We can use a spreadsheet to model a timing circuit. This enables us to create a circuit that satisfies the
needs of a specific situation (for example, a car courtesy light which needs to stay on for a desired length of
time). We can type in different possible values for the circuit components and see what the outcome will
be, before building
                 the circuit. FigA shows how such a spreadsheet might appear.
You can create the spreadsheet without doing any experimentation. Give the various cells formulae to
calculate what capacitor theory tells us will happen, using the mathematics on these pages. For example,
the cell giving the time constant, 7, does not require input from the user - it is programmed to display the
multiplication of the capacitance and the discharge resistance. This value is then used in the formula for
calculating the values in the current column, using the equation, I = Ipe~“*S, or | = [pe

ULTRACAPACITORS
Generally, we have not made the switch from petrol cars to electric cars very quickly. Most people think that they are not able to store
enough energy, they have a limited range between charges and they take a long time to charge. Ultracapacitors have been suggested as
a possible solution to these problems, as a replacement for electrochemical rechargeable batteries.

DID YOU KNOW?
Isolated capacitors can hold their charge for years without losing much at all. It is important that any
unfamiliar large capacitor is assumed to be fully charged, as it could give a shock if it discharges
through you.

                               EFFECTS
     Industrial electricity generation is vital in our technological world. Nearly every device is electrically powered
     now, so the physics behind generating electricity is very important. Electric and magnetic fields are connected;            ~
     changing one either automatically generates or changes the other.

     As with all things, the conservation of energy is very important and this affects the change of movement into
     electricity. However, electrical energy being transferred to kinetic energy is also very important in today’s world.
     This is the opposite of the generation of electricity, and we will look at it in this chapter too. Other machines such
     as particle accelerators and mass spectrometers are also affected by the equations in this chapter.

     Finally, we will see how these effects make electrical transformers work. The way transformers change energy
     from electric current into magnetic fields and back again is the closest people have come to creating a perfectly
     efficient machine.




          Recognising and use of appropriate units (e.g. the tesla)

          Substituting numerical values into equations (e.g. calculate magnetic flux linkage)

          Understanding the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of the rate of change (e.g. induced e.m,f. as the rate
          of change of magnetic flux linkage)

          Use of angles in 2D and 3D structures (e.g. finding the magnetic flux linkage when a coil area is at an angle to the
          magnetic field direction)

          Distinguishing between instantaneous and average rates of change (e.g. comparing the e.m.f. induced at different
          times as a magnet falls through a coil)

FLUX LINKAGE
The interaction between magnetic fields and charged particles, or conductors, allows motors to
operate, and electricity to be generated. In most practical applications, magnetic flux is made to
interact with a coil of wire, as the effect on a single strand of wire is too small to be useful. If the
single wire is coiled up, then the magnetic field can interact with each turn on the coil, and so any
effect is multiplied V times, where Nis the number of turns on the coil.

The amount of magnetic flux interacting with a coil of wire is known as the flux linkage, and is the
product of the number of turns of wire and the flux in that region:

       flux linkage = N® measured in weber-turns

Remembering that ® = BA means that we also have:
       flux linkage = BAN



 WORKED EXAMPLE 2
 Zoran takes a wire and winds it into a coil of ten circular turns with a radius of 5 cm and then holds this in
 a magnetic field with a strength of
                                   20 mT. What is the flux linkage?

                                           FLEMING’S LEFT HAND RULE
                                           Magnetic fields can affect moving electric charges, as well as magnetic poles. If you place a wire
                                           in a magnetic field and pass a current through it, the wire will experience a force on it (fig A). This
                                           is called the motor effect. The effect is greatest when the wire and the magnetic field are at right
                                           angles. In this instance, the force will be at right angles to both, in the third dimension, as shown by

                                           observed in fig D, it will be moving away from us. With the magnetic field from north to south (towards the
                                           right in fig D), Fleming's left hand rule tells us that the wire will experience a force pushing it downwards.

 PRACTICAL SKILLS
 Build your own motor
 The forced movement of a current-carrying conductor within a
 magnetic field is the principle that causes motors to work. From
 Fleming's left hand rule, it is clear that a coil of wire experiences a
 turning forceif the wire is carrying a current and is put in a magnetic
 field. This is because the current travels in opposite directions on
 opposite sides of the coil which causes forces in opposite directions
 and rotates the coil. If it is free to move, then the coil (or motor) will
 spin continuously. If you use the apparatus in fig E, remember
                                                              to use

                                      by the detector. The intensity of the current in the detector can indicate the proportion of a given
                                      chemical within the sample.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
We have seen that the movement of a charged particle in a magnetic field causes it to experience
a force. Newton’s third law of motion reminds us that this force must have a counterpart that acts
equally in the opposite direction. This pair of electromagnetic forces is generated whenever there is
relative motion between a charge and a magnetic field. So, a magnetic field moving past a stationary
charge will create the same force. The velocity term in the expression F = Bqv actually refers to the
relative (perpendicular) velocity between the magnetic field lines and g. (Also remember that if the
movement is not at right angles, then we need to work out the component of it that is at right angles
by including the sin6 term: F = Bqvsin 6.)

This means that if we move a magnet near a wire, the electrons in the wire will experience a force
to make them move through the wire. This is an e.m.f; if the wire is in a complete circuit, then the
electrons will move, forming an electric current. We can use this principle to generate electricity.
Reversing the direction of the magnetic field, or the direction of the relative motion, will reverse the
direction of the force on the electrons, reversing the polarity of the e.m.£. Faraday’s law states that
the induced e.m.f is proportional to the rate of change of flux linkage.

                            Investigating Faraday's law
                            You can investigate Faraday’s law using a magnet and a coil of wire connected to a voltage datalogger, as
                            shown in fig B, or more simply, using the set up in fig A.

                           Conservation of energy gives us Lenz’s law, which says that ‘the direction of an induced emf. is
                           such as to oppose the change creating it’.


                           ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION USING AN ELECTROMAGNET
                           In the previous section, the induction of e.m.f. was a result of the relative motion between a
                           conductor, or coil, and a permanent magnet. The magnetic field which interacts with the coil could
                           be produced electrically by another coil. This is the principle of operation of a transformer, and the
                           coil producing the initial magnetic field is referred to as the primary coil.

                           In fig C we have a pair of coils linked together by a soft iron core. Iron is extremely good at carrying
                           magnetism and, in the set-up shown, nearly all the magnetic field generated by the primary coil on
                           the left would interact with the secondary coil on the right. When the primary switch is first closed,
                           the primary suddenly produces a magnetic field that was not previously there. This means that a
                           changing magnetic field is now within the secondary coil. This sudden change of flux linkage will
                           generate an e.m.f. in the secondary. However, once the electromagnetic field is stable there will no
                           longer be any change in flux linkage over time, and so there will be no further induced e.mf. in the
                           secondary. The voltmeter needle will kick and then return to zero. If the primary circuit is switched
                           off, the magnetic field it produces will suddenly disappear, and a brief e.m.f. will be induced in the
                           opposite direction to the switch-on voltage. The voltmeter needle will kick in the opposite direction
                           and then return to zero again.

Using a process involving electromagnetic induction to detect
metal objects was first proposed by Alexander Graham Bell, also
the inventor of the telephone. Today, metal detectors are used by
a variety of people in many different industries. For example, for
finding underground water pipes, and by archaeologists looking for
old metal objects.

CHAPTER




          7A                  PROBING MATTER
     Throughout       history, people have been trying to work out what everything      is made from. The ancient Greek
     philosopher Democritus wondered how many times a piece of cheese could be cut smaller and smaller, until we
     reach the point where the cheese remaining is a fundamental unit that will not split. This was the basis of the
     theory that everything is made from unbreakable fundamental particles.

     In the late    nineteenth century, the atom was thought to be the smallest possible particle, but then the English
     physicistJ.J.Thomson demonstrated that electrons could be removed, so the atom must be made of smaller
     pieces. This led to some of the most important experiments of the twentieth century: Rutherford’s alpha particle
     scattering experiments from 1909, which led to the development of the idea that an atom has a small central
     nucleus and outer orbiting electrons.

     In this chapter, both the movement of free electrons in a beam, and the details of Rutherford’s alpha particle
     scattering experiment will be explained. Using particle beams as probes to investigate the detailed structure of
     matter is one of the most important areas of physics study, and in future chapters we will see how these
     experiments led to the very latest developments in particle physics experimentation.

                                 CHADWICK’S DISCOVERY OF THE NEUTRON
                                 Rutherford determined that most of the atom’s mass and all the positive charge was held in a very
                                 small nucleus in the centre, and that electrons were at the edge of the atom. The difference between
                                 the nuclear mass and the known number of protons in it caused a problem though. Nuclei were too
                                 massive considering the number of protons they contained. Rutherford suggested that additional
                                 proton-electron pairs, bound together, were the extra mass in the nucleus.

                                 In 1930, Irene Joliot-Curie and her husband, Frederic, found that alpha particles hitting beryllium
                                 would cause it to give off an unknown radiation. Difficult to detect, this unknown, uncharged
                                 radiation could remove protons from paraffin and these were detected by a Geiger-Miller tube.

                                 NUCLEAR STRUCTURE
                                 As we have seen, the nucleus contains two types of particles: protons and neutrons. In the nucleus,
                                 these particles are all known as nucleons. The number of protons in a nucleus determines which
                                 element the atom will be. The periodic table is a list of the elements in the order of the number of
                                 protons in each atom’s nucleus. This number is called the proton number or the atomic number
                                 (Z). The number of neutrons can be different, and we call atoms of the same element with different
                                 numbers of neutrons, isotopes. For small nuclei, up to about atomic number 20 (which is calcium),
                                 the number of neutrons in the nucleus is generally equal to the number of protons.

                                 Above atomic number 20, to be stable, more neutrons than protons are needed in the nucleus. The
                                 neutrons help to bind the nucleus together as they exert a strong nuclear force on other nucleons,
                                 and they act as a space between the positive charges of the protons which all repel each other. This
                                 means that as we progress through the periodic table to larger and larger nuclei, proportionately
                                 more and more neutrons are needed. By the time we reach the very biggest nuclei, there can be over
                                 50% more neutrons than protons.

                                 To describe any nucleus, we must say how many protons and how many neutrons there are. So
                                 the chemical symbol written below refers to the isotope of radium, which has 88 protons and 138
                                 neutrons:

                                        226



                                 The number 226, called the nucleon number or the mass number (A), refers to the total number
                                 of nucleons — neutrons and protons ~ in a nucleus of this isotope. So to find the number of neutrons,
                                 we must subtract the atomic number from the mass number: 226 — 88 = 138.
 PROBING MATTER                                                                                                                                 77


As radium must have 88 protons because that makes it radium, it is quite common not to write the
88. You might call this isotope ‘radium-226' and this will be enough information to know its proton
number and neutron number.


A QUANTUM MECHANICAL ATOM
In the 1920s, Werner Heisenberg changed the model of the atom, which had electrons in orbits like
planets in a Solar System. His uncertainty principle says that we cannot know the exact position and
velocity of anything at a given moment. Instead of specific orbits, his new version of the atom has
regions around the nucleus in which there is a high probability of finding an electron, and the shapes
of these ‘probability clouds’ represent what we currently refer to as the electron ‘orbitals’.

A DAY OF XENON COLLISIONS AT CERN
  The image to the right shows what happened in the CMS particle
  detector when xenon nuclei were circulated in the LHC and
  brought into head-on collision. The yellow is made up of tracks
  of electrically-charged particles, produced in such numbers
  that the whole of the centre of the picture is a yellow blur, with
  individual tracks only visible near the edges. The blue and green
  blocks indicate energy deposited by both charged and neutral
  particles in the CMS calorimeter.

  Collisions between protons look significantly less busy than this,
  with fewer particles produced. But both xenon and lead nuclei
  are packed with protons and neutrons, and though lead has more
  of them, I don’t think anyone could tell the difference between a
  xenon-xenon collision and a lead-lead one by eye.

  There are however expected to be differences in detail, on                 There should be no confusion really. According to the Standard

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics elsewhere
in this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out
the answers.
3 Write a paragraph to explain the structure of the xenon nuclei being used, and how this
    compares with lead nuclei previously used.

4 How would xenon nuclei and lead nuclei be affected if they moved across a magnetic field?          some numbers in your answers.
    Explain the differences in effect on these two particles travelling through the same magnetic
    field.
5   Explain the physics behind the following phrases from the extract:
    (a) ‘Collisions between protons look significantly less busy than this’
    (b) ““control’ measurements, a good way of reducing systematic uncertainties’
6 Give an order of magnitude approximation of the ratio of the diameters ofa xenon nucleus and
    a Higgs boson.

      |        solar systems next to each other. Now compare your size to that of the thousand solar systems. That difference is
               the same as the size of the proton compared to you.

                Developing both the theories and the technology to move subatomic particles so that we can do experiments
               with them is one of the great triumphs of modern science. The Large Hadron Collider, which is our greatest

WAS EINSTEIN RIGHT?
One of Einstein’s claims in his theory of special relativity is that nothing can accelerate beyond the
speed of light. This means that particles in accelerators must have a problem when they are already
travelling close to the speed of light and then pass through a p.d. which should accelerate them
beyond it. In 1964, William Bertozzi demonstrated that at very high speeds, particles deviate from the
equation t mv’ = qV and never accelerate beyond the speed of light.
By measuring the actual speed of electrons accelerated from a Van de Graaff generator and then
determining their actual kinetic energy by colliding them with a target and measuring the heat
generated, Bertozzi was able to show that the energy added by the accelerating p.d. started to

become more than the amount expected from $n”
This demonstration showed that whilst the kinetic energy and momentum of particles can continue
to increase without limit, their speed does not. This can only happen if the mass of a particle
seemingly increases with its speed. This apparent mass increase becomes significant at speeds
approaching light speed — known as ‘relativistic speeds’.

of the kinetic energy). However, these experiments generally send
particles at speeds approaching the speed of light, so relativistic
effects need to be accounted for. In particular, at these very high
speeds the particle’s mass appears to increase, which would
also change its momentum. The overall result is that a particle
increasing in speed would travel along an outwardly spiralling path.

                                   The GM tube works on the principle that is common to most particle detectors: ionisation. As the
                                   particle to be detected passes through the tube, it ionises atoms of a gas (typically argon) which fills the
                                   tube. The ions and electrons produced are accelerated by an electric field between electrodes in the
                                   tube and then discharged when they reach the electrodes. This produces a pulse of electricity, which is
                                   counted by a counter connected to the tube. Many different types of detector have been invented by
                                   particle physicists, but the majority detect ionisation caused by the particles to be detected.


                                   ANALYSING DETECTIONS
                                   Particle-counting detectors are useful, but they cannot distinguish between different types of particles.
                                   This is becoming very important in detectors. Modern particle physics experiments are carried out
                                   using such high energies that they can produce hundreds of different types of particles. Unless the
                                   detectors used in these experiments can identify properties of the particles, such as their energy,
                                   charge or mass, then the experimental results will be useless. In Section 6C.3 we saw how the mass
                                   spectrometer deflects an ion using a magnetic field. The ion can then be identified by the amount of
                                   defiection, since this is dependent on the mass and charge of the ion, and the strength and direction
                                   of the magnetic field used.

     B A hydrogen bubble chamber

Particle physics experiments took a major leap forward with the invention of the bubble chamber
detector (fig B). Professor Siegbahn of the Swedish Academy of Sciences commented when
presenting the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics:

   “Dr. Glaser, your invention of the ‘bubble chamber’ has opened up a new world for nuclear science.
   We can now observe with our own eyes all the strange processes which occur when high-energy beams
  from [particle accelerators] are directed into your chamber.”

Professor Siegbahn went on to explain that the bubble chamber acts like a combination of jet-plane
vapour trails and the bubbles that suddenly appear when you open a bottle of fizzy drink. Superheated
liquid hydrogen changes into bubbles of gas at any place where ions are generated within it. These
bubbles can be observed within the liquid and the trails of bubbles show the paths of moving particles.

   figC An image of particle tracks detected by a hydro   bubble chamber.

The particle tracks in fig C show how particles can be tracked as they progress through a bubble
chamber. Those affected by the magnetic field across it follow curved paths. The radius of curvature
of the tracks will tell us the mass and charge of the particles in the same way that it does in the mass
spectrometer. In addition, the picture allows us to analyse interactions as they happened, as the
tracks sometimes end abruptly or have sharp changes in direction when they collide. In some cases,
particle tracks appear to start from nothing. These show instances where particles have been created

monitoring the tracks of particles. The energies and momenta can
also be measured and they must be conserved. This conservation
means that all this information analysed together can identify all
the particles and reactions in each collision.


THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER BEAUTY
EXPERIMENT (LHCB)
This detector looks out for the decays of both the bottom quark
(sometimes called beauty) and the charm quark by looking for
mesons containing these. This is to work out why our Universe
contains mostly matter and very little anti-matter Theoretically
the two should appear in equal amounts.


A LARGE ION COLLIDER EXPERIMENT (ALICE)
Although ALICE initially observed the proton-proton collisions
that the LHC started with, this detector is particularly intended
to study the collisions of heavy ions, such as lead, accelerated
to almost the speed of light. These collisions started in the
second phase of LHC operation, and it is hoped they will create
a quark-gluon plasma, which has been predicted by quantum
mechanics theory.                                                                A.    fig D The ATLAS experiment detector in the LHC

ACCELERATORS
Particle accelerators can be used in medical applications. One of the most exciting possibilities is in cancer treatment, where a tumour
is bombarded with high-energy particles, which can deliver energy to kill the cancerous cells. They can target a very small volume, so
damage to surrounding tissue is less than with comparative treatments.

6 One of the most exciting aspects of this kind of cancer treatment is that, unlike X-ray or
    gamma ray treatment, the delivery of energy increases as the ion reaches the target tumour.
    As the particle slows down, it can interact with many more nearby particles, losing energy
    more quickly.

          7@_                THE PARTICLE ZOO
     On 4July 2012, there was a press conference at CERN, the particle physics experiments lab near Geneva, when
     the discovery of a particle believed to be the Higgs boson was announced. This particle was predicted in the
     1960s as the final component in the Standard Model. Physicists were excited by CERN’s discovery, as this is
     exp        ental confirmation of the only piece of the Standard Model that had not yet been confirmed to exist.
     And its mass was very close to a theoretically predicted value. The scientific      system of subatomic particles was
     completed. Experimental evidence of previous predictions is the foundation for the strongest scientific
     conclusions. This means that the Standard Model is a strong theory, and any corrections or alterations are now
     likely to be very minor.

     In this chapter, we will show the Standard Model, so that you can see how the few particles you already know fit
     into the overall theory. These particles are the fundamental building blocks of our Universe. How they interact is
     what determines the development and structure of everything there is. Everything you will ever see is a
     consequence of the ideas in this chapter!

This reaction is known as electron-positron pair production.
In momentum terms, it is just like an explosion. Initially only
the photon existed so there was some linear momentum. Along
this initial direction, their components of momentum must sum
to the same total as the photon had. Perpendicular to the initial
momentum, the electron and positron that were produced must
have equal and opposite components of momentum so that in this
direction it will still total zero afterwards.

In any reaction, the total combination of matter-energy must be
conserved. If we add the energy equivalent of all matter particles          figA The fictional starship Enterprise was said to be powered by a

with the energies, before and after the reaction, the numbers must
be equal.

as indivisible was swept aside by Rutherford and Thomson, and
the idea of the proton and neutron as being fundamental has also
been overturned. We have probed inside these two nucleons and
discovered that each is constructed from smaller particles known

BARYONS
If three quarks are combined together, the resulting particle is
a baryon (fig A). Protons and neutrons are baryons. A proton
consists of two up quarks and a down quark, whilst a neutron is
two down quarks combined with an up quark. Other baryons are
more obscure and have very short lives, as they decay through a
strong nuclear force reaction that makes them highly unstable. Yet

other baryons, like the sigma, omega and lambda particles, decay
via the weak nuclear force and are longer lived, with lives as long
as 10*° seconds!

understood, as the W and Z bosons that were predicted by theory
were later detected in accelerator experiments in which protons
are crashed together. This is particularly strong science, as the
existence of the weak nuclear force bosons had been theoretically
predicted and then they were detected in later experiments. Many
particle decays where other particles are formed, such as beta
decay, occur via a weak nuclear force interaction.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1 Use the laws of conservation of charge, baryon number and lepton number to determine whether a particle
   interaction is possible.
   Write and interpret particle equations given the relevant particle symbols.
@ Describe situations in which the relativistic increase in particle lifetime is significant.


                                REACTIONS CONSERVE PROPERTIES
                                For any particle reaction to occur, the overall reaction must conserve various properties of the particles
                                involved. The total combination of mass/energy must be the same before and after the reaction.
                                Furthermore, momentum and charge must also be conserved. Momentum and mass/energy are difficult
                                to check. In a reaction, particles can begin or end with more kinetic energy to balance any apparent
                                mass difference. This is how accelerator collision experiments can create large mass particles: particles
                                with high kinetic energies can have the energy converted into mass to generate many particles with less
                                energy. Reactions can also have similar flexibility to ensure momentum conservation. We will see later
                                that particles are also assigned values called baryon number and lepton number, and these must also be
                                conserved in reactions.


                                CHARGE CONSERVATION
                                Charge must be conserved for any particle interaction to be possible. We can quickly see if charge
                                is conserved by checking the reaction’s equation. Consider two common nuclear reactions: alpha
                                decay and beta-minus decay (fig A).

                                The reaction for beta-minus decay led to the development of the theory that neutrinos and anti-
                                neutrinos exist. They are almost massless and have no charge, so are almost impossible to detect.

 For each of these reactions, confirm whether or not they can occur                      Particle reactions can also only occur if they conserve baryon and

 through conservation of charge:                                                         lepton numbers overall. This means the total for each property must

                        This provides further evidence that this reaction produces an anti-neutrino because the reaction must
                        have an anti-lepton on the right-hand side to balance the electron.

                        If we zoom in further and isolate the individual quark decay reaction in beta decay, we can check again:

                        Again, everything is conserved.


                        STRANGENESS
                        The strange quark adds an additional property to reactions, which must usually also be conserved.
                        This is called strangeness, S. Each strange quark has a strangeness of —1, each anti-strange
                        quark has S = +1, and all other particles have zero strangeness. Strong and electromagnetic force
                        interactions must conserve strangeness.


                         WORKED EXAMPLE 2
                         The lambda-plus particle is a baryon and consists of two up quarks and a strange quark (uus). It
                         commonly decays via the strong force into a proton (uud) and a neutral pion (which can be uU or dd).

                         This reaction cannot occur via a strong force as it does not conserve strangeness.



                        RELATIVISTIC LIFETIMES
                        We have seen previously (Section 7B.1) that when a particle is accelerated close to the speed of
                        light, its mass appears to increase. Einstein also predicted that, at these speeds, time would be slower
                        than it is for an external observer. This suggests that when we monitor very fast-moving particles,
                        their lifetimes before they decay are longer than the theoretical predictions.

                        One early piece of evidence of these extended particle lifetimes came with the detection of muons
                        at sea level. High energy cosmic rays interact with the nuclei of atoms high in the atmosphere to
                        create muons, which have a lifetime of about 2 ys. These should all decay in much less than the
                        time to travel down to the Earth’s surface, and we should detect very few at sea level. However, they
                        are detected at low altitudes in large numbers. The reason is that they are travelling very fast (for
                        example 0.98¢). As far as the muons are concerned, they still decay in the same short time; but for us
                        as external observers, their time moves slowly enough for them to travel tens of kilometres down to
                        our experiments on the ground. This phenomenon was first confirmed experimentally by Rossi and
                        Hall in 1940.

                        This principle also affects the particle interactions observed in accelerator collision experiments. The
                        particles live longer, and travel further, than we might expect because they are moving so fast. This
                        allows many additional interactions to happen because they meet particles they might not otherwise
                        have had time to come into contact with. Also, the fast-moving particles that will travel much further
                        through the detectors than non-relativistic lifetimes would allow, and so can be more easily observed.
                        If the exotic particles produced in the LHC collision chamber decayed within the chamber before
                        escaping it, none would be detectable, as the detector cannot be placed right at the collision point.

             The phosphorus isotope is converted into a sulfur isotope and emits a positron and an electron
             neutrino:

                        iP = ES + $B + Ove
          (b) neutral pion decay.

             Aneutral pion becomes an electron, a positron and a gamma photon:

 2.       A muon is generated in the atmosphere at a height of 10 km. Calculate how far it would travel down
         towards the ground if it was moving at 0.98 c and it decays after 2.2 x 10°6s.
 3.       Beta plus decay is similar
                                   to the better known beta-minus decay. In beta-plus decay, a proton is
         converted into a neutron, with the emission of a positron and an electron neutrino.

         Write the fundamental reaction for beta-plus decay and confirm that it is permitted by the
         conservation rules you have seen.

4. One theoretical physicist at CERN has proposed that the LHC may see a neutron decay reaction in
         which a lambda zero particle (up, down, strange baryon) and a kaon (down/anti-strange meson) are
         produced:

                  proposed reaction 1 jn => jA+SK
        A second theoretical physicist at CERN has argued that the reaction will have to produce two kaons as
        well as a positron and an anti-neutrino:

                  proposed reaction 2 {n> JA +29K+%e"+ 90,
        Work out which reaction, if any, is possible.

Anti-matter was first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928. It is very interesting for both science fiction writers and scientists because it is
such a strange idea. Here, NASA's website explains the progress that has been made towards using the energy of anti-matter

TOPIC 8 THERMODYNAMICS
CHAPTER




                 A               HEAT AND TEMPERATURE
     When scuba divers need to return to the surface of the water in an emergency, they are trained to scream all the
     way up. This may sounda little strange, but the training is designed to ensure that they do not have to think about
     expelling the gas in their lungs, as this happens automatically when they scream. As the pressure decreases on their
     way to the surface, the air in their lungs expands. This could be very dangerous to their internal organs, particularly
     their lungs, and so the air must be expelled at least as fast as it expands. This is illustrated in a similar, although less
     extreme, scenario: the bubbles from a diver’s normal exhaled breath will slowly get larger as they rise to the surface.

     This chapter is all about the energy held by individual molecules, and how, on a large scale, this energy is
     responsible for many macroscopic effects, such as the pressure exerted by a gas on a diver’s lungs. We will learn
     about a large number of rules governing the properties of gases, including their pressure, temperature, volume and
     quantity. These will be explained from first principles in terms of the molecules that make up the gas. In a more
     general sense, we will see how the energy possessed by a group of molecules leads to the temperature of a sample
     and the transfer of heat energy.

          Finding arithmetic means (e.g. mean square speeds of gas molecules)

          Use of ratios   (e.g. illustrating the gas laws)

          Estimating results (e.g. predicting the outcome on a gas of changes in its properties)

 Many electronic components have a switch on voltage of 5 V. For
 example, the control circuit to switch on a large air conditioner could
 be used with a thermistor in a potential divider circuit and would
 only switch on when the p.d. across it is 5 V. Altering the value of the
 other resistor in the potential divider circuit would then control the
 temperature level at which the air conditioner was switched on.

 You can use a circuit like that shown in fig
                                            C to find the output
 voltage at different temperatures to calibrate the thermistor. This
 calibration should then allow you to replace the fixed resistor with a
 variable resistor that you can set, so that the output exceeds 5 volts
 only when a particular temperature     is reached.

   circuit as they may get hot enough to burn skin.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1 Define the concepts of specific heat capacity and specific latent heat for phase changes.
@ Use the equations AE = mcA@ and AE = LAm.


                                    We have seen that the temperature of a substance depends on the kinetic energy of the molecules
                                    within it. As the molecules move, their bonds can pull on neighbouring molecules. This means that
                                    lattice vibrations in the solid can pass energy through the solid.

                                    Imagine that one end of a long rod is being heated. In the hotter parts of the metal, the molecules
                                    are vibrating faster and further. In the cooler parts of the rod, further from the heat source, the
                                    molecules are moving slower. When a molecule with more energy pulls on one with less energy, they
                                    share the energy more evenly, with the faster one slowing down and the slower one speeding up. The
                                    effect of these transfers is that the increase in the internal kinetic energy which is caused by heating
                                    moves throughout a substance, with the heat passing from hotter areas to colder ones.

                                     How long will a 2 kW kettle take to raise the temperature of 800 grams of water from 20°C to 100°C? The

                                    Therefore the kettle takes 2 minutes and 14 seconds to heat this water to boiling temperature. We assume
                                    that no energy is wasted in heating the surroundings.

                    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

      @ Define the concept of internal energy as the random distribution of potential and kinetic energies amongst molecules.
      IH Use the equation 5 m<c?> = 34T.

The average kinetic energy of the particles in a material gives the material its temperature. However,
in addition to this kinetic energy, each molecule will have some potential energy which is as a result of
its position within the structure of the material, or in relation to other molecules in the substance. This
potential energy is due to the bonds between the molecules. If we sum the kinetic and potential energies
of all the molecules within a given mass of a substance, we have measured its internal energy.

It is important to note that the molecules do not all have the same amount of kinetic and potential
energies. This internal energy is randomly distributed across all the molecules, according to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.


THE MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION
If we identify the individual velocity of each molecule in a particular sample, the values will range                              In kinetic theory, we use the
from a few moving very slowly to a few moving very fast, with the majority moving at close to the                                  word ‘molecules’ to describe
average speed. As they all have the same mass, their differences in kinetic energies are directly                                  any particles. For example, if we

A                   fig
                      A The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the speeds ofa mixture of particles at one particular temperature.

The characteristic shape of the graph in fig A shows that:
+                   there are no molecules with zero energy
*                   only a few molecules have high energy
+                   there is no maximum value for the energy a molecule can have.

A Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution graph is for one specific temperature. As the temperature
changes, so the graph changes. The peak on the graph moves towards higher energies (and therefore
higher speeds) as the temperature increases.


ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE CALCULATIONS
There are two different ways of determining the average speeds of molecules in a material which are
of interest to physicists. The peak of the graph represents the kinetic energy value with the greatest
number of molecules that have that energy. Therefore the speed corresponding to this kinetic energy
is the most probable speed, ¢, if we were to select a molecule at random. The second and more useful
average is the root-mean-square speed, which has the symbol \<c?>. This is the speed associated
with the average kinetic energy, im <c?>, where cis the speed of the particle, and m is its mass.

BOYLE’S LAW
During the last 400 years, scientists investigating the physics of gases have determined a number of
laws governing their behaviour. The first of these was discovered by Robert Boyle, an Irish physicist
working at Oxford University. Boyle’s law states that:
For a constant mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure exerted by the gas is inversely proportional
to the volume it occupies.

If you imagine lying on an air mattress, after you sink slightly, it provides a force to hold you up. Your
body squashes the volume of the mattress, making it smaller This increases the pressure exerted by the
gas inside, until the force applied by the gas pressure equals your weight. This is Boyle’s law in action.

 Investigating Boyle's law

 Boyle's law can be demonstrated using the apparatus shown in fig A.
 Measurements of the length of air which is trapped in the vertical
 glass column represent the volumeof the gas, and the pressure is
 measured using the barometer. A graph of pressure against 1/volume
 will give a straight best-fit line indicating that:

CHAPTER




          Radiation is scary. At least, that is what most people believe. When the USA dropped nuclear bombs on Japan
          in 1945, the Japanese suffered so many casualties that they surrendered within days. However, there is
          radioactivity naturally all around us. Having a picnic on a rock in a     national park could easily expose you to
          more radioactivity than undertaking experiments in school using radioactive sources. Coal-fired power
          stations release more radioactivity to the environment, but nuclear power stations emit more radioactivity
          from their fuel. It is important to understand the evidence which relates to hazards in all areas of life.
          However, nuclear physics is poorly understood by the public and its hazards are often overstated.

          In this chapter, we will learn what radioactivity is, how it can be dangerous, and how these hazards can be
          reduced. We will also see how the energy stored in the nuclei of atoms can be measured, where it comes from,
          and how it can be used as a power source.

                                 BACKGROUND RADIATION
                                 Human beings can survive small doses of nuclear radiation. This has been important in our
                                 evolution, as the natural environment has low levels of radiation from natural sources. This is called
                                 background radiation. The level varies from place to place around the world. For example, in the
                                 UK it averages to less than one radioactive particle every two seconds in any given place (fig A).
                                 If we measure background radiation using a Geiger-Muller (G-M) tube, the number of counts per
                                 second usually ranges from 0.2-0.5 depending on exact location. Radiation levels are often reported
                                 in counts per second, and this unit is called the becquerel (Bq). Henri Becquerel was the French
                                 physicist who discovered spontaneous radiation in 1896.

 Investigating background radiation
 It is easy to determine the average background radiation in your area
 using a Geiger-Miiller tube and counter. As radioactive decay is a
 random and spontaneous process, the activity in your lab must be
 measured over a long period of time (30 minutes or more) and then an
 average calculated. Otherwise, you may find that the measurement is, by            paper   lead   aluminium

Many nuclei are slightly unstable and there is a small probability
that, each second, they may decay. This means that a nucleon
may change from one type to another, or the composition or
energy state of the nucleus as a whole may change. When a
nuclear decay occurs, the radiation particle emitted will leave
the nucleus carrying kinetic energy. As the particle travels, it will
ionise particles in its path, losing some of that kinetic energy at                                                                 alpha

                                    A beta particle is an electron emitted at high speed from the nucleus when a neutron decays into a
                                    proton. With its single negative charge and much smaller size, the beta particle is much less ionising
                                    than an alpha particle, and thus can penetrate much further. Several metres of air, or a thin sheet of
                                    aluminium, are needed to absorb beta particles.

                                    Gamma ray emission does not change the structure of a nucleus emitting it, but carries away energy,
                                    so the nucleus must drop energy level in order to emit the gamma ray. This most commonly happens
                                    immediately after alpha or beta decay, which leaves the nucleus in an excited state. The emission of

 Investigating lead absorption of gamma radiation
 Using the same experimental set-up as shown in fig B, we can find out how much lead is needed to reduce
 the intensity of gamma radiation by a particular amount. Using a radioactive source that emits alpha and
 gamma only, we can select to study the gamma radiation by placing a sheet of paper in front of the source to
 absorb all the alpha particles. This will have no measurable effect on the gamma emissions.
 Keeping the distance from the source to the G-M tube constant, we can place different thicknesses of lead
 plate in the gap between them. For each thickness, record the count over a fixed time period and determine
 the corrected count rate. There is a mathematical relationship between the corrected count rate (which
 represents intensity ofthe radiation, !) and the thickness, x, of lead. Work out what graph to draw to prove
 that lx eTM.

DANGERS FROM NUCLEAR RADIATIONS
lonising radiations can interact with the particles that human cells consist of. There may be so much
ionisation that it causes the cells to die. Where there is less ionisation, the molecules of DNA in the
cells may change slightly. These DNA mutations can cause cells to have an increased tendency to
become cancerous. As the different types of nuclear radiation ionise to different extents, the hazard
to humans is different for each type. The hazard levels are given in table A.

table A Masses of sub-atomic particles

We might expect that if we know the constituent parts of any nucleus, we can calculate its mass by
finding the total mass of its nucleons. However, in practice we find that the actual, measured mass of
a nucleus is always /ess than the total mass of its constituent nucleons. This difference is called the
mass deficit, Am, or sometimes the mass defect, Am.

                          NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY
                          The mass deficit comes about because a small amount of the mass of the nucleons is converted into
                          the energy needed to hold the nucleus together. This is called binding energy, A£. It is calculated
                          using Einstein's mass-energy relationship:

                                AE=CAm

                          where cis the speed of light.

                          There are two common systems of units for calculating binding energy. If you have calculated the
                          mass deficit in kilograms
                          (SI units) then using c = 3.00 x 10°ms~ will give the binding energy in joules. Alternatively, if you
                          have calculated the mass deficit in atomic mass units, then you convert this into binding energy in
                          mega-electronvolts (MeV) using:
                                Tu=931.5MeV

                           Working in kilograms, from fig A:

                                 Am = 1.642 354 x 10-8 kg

                                  AE = c?Am

                           Converting to electronvolts:
                                        1.478 x 101
                                  AE=
                                         1.6 = 1079
                                     = 9.226 x 10’eV
                                     = 92.3 MeV

                           Alternatively, working in atomic mass units, from fig
                                                                               A:

                                  Am = 0.098 937 u

                                  AE = 9315 x Am

                                      = 931.5 x 0.098 937

                                      = 92.2 MeV

                           Note that in calculations of both mass deficit and binding energy, you need to use as many significant
                           figures as possible, only rounding off at the very end of the calculation. The difference in
                           our two answers here has come from rounding off the binding energy answer in joules.



                          BINDING ENERGY PER NUCLEON
                          How much energy would be needed to remove one nucleon from a nucleus? To work this out we need
                          to know both the binding energy of a nucleus, and the number of nucleons within it. This gives us the
                          binding energy per nucleon in a nucleus in MeV, and from this we can determine how strongly different
                          nuclei are held together.

                           WORKED EXAMPLE 3
                           Does helium-4 or carbon-12 have the higher binding energy per nucleon?

                           The binding energy of helium-4 is 28.3 MeV, and it contains 4 nucleons:

                                  binding energy per nucleon = 283 = 7.08 MeV
                           The binding energy for carbon-12 is 92.2 MeV, and it contains 12 nucleons:

                                  binding energy per nucleon = 22 = 7.68 MeV
                           So, carbon-12 nuclei are more tightly bound together than those of helium-4.

Drawing a graph of binding energy per nucleon against mass number for the nuclei gives us a useful

Looking at fig B, you will see that the isotope with the highest binding energy per nucleon is iron-56
at 8.8 MeV per nucleon. Any nuclear reaction which increases the binding energy per nucleon will
give out energy.

The graph shows us that small nuclides can combine together to make larger nuclei (up to Fe-56)
with a greater binding energy per nucleon. This process is called nuclear fusion. Similarly, larger
nuclei can break up into smaller pieces which have a greater binding energy per nucleon than the
original nucleus. Reactions like this are called nuclear fission. Both of these types of nuclear reaction
will give out energy, and could be used as power sources.



NUCLEAR FUSION
If we take some light nuclei and force them to join together, the mass of the new heavier nucleus
will be less than the mass of the constituent parts, as some mass is converted into energy. However,
not all of this energy is used as binding energy for the new larger nucleus, so energy will be released
from this reaction. The binding energy per nucleon afterwards is higher than at the start. This is the
process of nuclear fusion and is what provides the energy to make stars shine (fig C).

Some medical diagnosis procedures use radioactive isotopes. The radiation emitted from them can be detected by a special camera
which allows doctors to find out what is happening inside a patient without surgery.




MEDICAL IMAGING FACES SHORTAGE OF KEY
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
The shutdown of a Canadian nuclear reactor creates a greater than 50
percent chance of a shortage of an important medical testing marker.

Doctors use radioactive isotopes in a range of diagnostic procedures.
They are chemically attached to other compounds that accumulate in
a target organ. Once there, the isotopes emit radiation that specialized
camera equipment picks up. The procedure is fast and, unlike biopsies and
surgical procedures, non-invasive. The radiation dose is generally low and
does not pose a significant health risk.

Created by the radioactive decay of molybdenum-99, technetium-99m
(Tc-99m) is the most popular medical isotope, used in about 80 percent of
the imaging procedures that rely on radioactive tracers. It is an unstable
form of technetium-99, an isotope of the radioactive element technetium
whose nucleus contains 99 protons plus neutrons.


A Complex Supply Chain

Tc-99m has a half-life — the time it takes for half of it to decay
radioactively — of only six hours once it’s produced. So it can’t be shipped
over long distances. Instead, most hospitals receive the parent isotope
molybdenum-99 and let it decay into Tc-99m on site.

Complicating the situation, Mo-99 itself has a half-life of only 66 hours.
That means that it can’t be stockpiled. As a result, the process of transport
from reactor to patient is complicated and filled with logistical, security                                                   |

Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions will link to topics elsewhere in
this book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out the
answers.

   (b) Explain why a medical tracer should be a gamma emitter for patient health reasons.

   itis 6 hours.

   (a) How much technetium-99 m would be produced in one week by a sample of 200 g of
       molybdenum-99?

   (b) From a dose of 47 mg of technetium-99m, how much would be left undecayed after

   (c) Explain why the half-life of 6 hours for Tc-99m is considered to be both usefully long, and
       also safely short.

Oscillations are common in everyday life, and studying them can be fun! The mathematics governing these
oscillations could be considered less fun, but actually is much easier than it may look when all the equations are
written out together.

In this chapter we will concentrate on simple harmonic oscillations, as these are the most common and help to
find useful solutions to engineering problems. We will look at how oscillations can be used for fun in everyday
life, from playground toys to nightclub music.

Oscillations can also get out of control, which can be damaging or dangerous. In Angers, France, in 1850, over
220 soldiers died as the bridge they were crossing collapsed into the cold river below. It is believed that the
rhythmic marching of the soldiers caused the bridge to oscillate too much and this broke the corroded cables
that supported it. Following this disaster, and some other similar bridge collapses, soldiers are now trained to
march out of step across bridges so as to avoid generating excessive oscillations.

We will see how such large oscillations develop and what can be done to reduce the problems they cause. These
solutions range from car suspension systems to earthquake protection systems in skyscrapers.

                             BOUNCING AND SWINGING
                             There are many things around us which oscillate (figs A and B). This means they have continuously
                             repeated movements. For example, a child’s swing goes backwards and forwards through the same
                             positions over and over again. If it swings freely, it will always take the same time to complete one
                             full swing. This is known as its time period, T. It follows a system of movements known as simple
                             harmonic motion (SHM). When a system is moving in SHM, a force, known as a restoring force,
                             F, is trying to return the object to its equilibrium position, and this force is proportional to the
                             displacement, x, from that equilibrium position.

                             where k is a constant dependent on the oscillating system in question. The negative sign in the
                             equation shows us that the acceleration will always be towards the centre of oscillation.

                             You will notice that the SHM definition is the same equation as in Hooke’s law, and the oscillation of
                             amass attached to a spring is an example of SHM. We can find the equation for the period of the
                             oscillations of a mass, m, subject to a Hooke’s law restoring force:

PENDULUM DYNAMICS
Apparently, when Galileo was just 17, he was watching a hanging lantern in the cathedral in Pisa and he observed that a pendulum’s
time period is independent of the size of the oscillations. In fact, the period for a pendulum is given by the expression:
                [Tr
         T= dmg


Therefore, the period is only dependent on the length, /, of the pendulum string, and the strength of gravity on the planet on which it
has been set up.



 WORKED EXAMPLE 2
 The pendulum which operates a grandfather clock is 100 cm long. What is the period of oscillation?

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 @ Apply the conservation of energy to undamped oscillating systems.



CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
An oscillator is a closed system which means that it cannot gain or lose energy, unless there is an
external influence. For example, a pendulum under water will not continue to swing for very long.
This is because the viscous drag on the pendulum from the water provides an external force, which
can do work to remove energy from the pendulum system. A child on a swing can continue to
oscillate, despite air resistance removing energy, if there is also a parent pushing repeatedly (doing
work) to put energy back into the system. Such damped or forced oscillations will be dealt with in the
next sections. Here we will only consider a closed system in which no energy moves in or out of the
system during its oscillations.


ENERGY TRANSFERS DURING OSCILLATION
The kinetic energy of a pendulum varies during its swinging motion. At each end of the swing, the bob
is stationary for an instant, meaning that it has zero kinetic energy at these points. The kinetic energy
then increases steadily until it reaches a maximum, when the bob passes through the central position
and is moving with its maximum speed. The kinetic energy then decreases to reach zero at the other
amplitude position. This cycle repeats continuously. However, once swinging, the pendulum system
cannot gain or lose energy. The varying kinetic energy must be transferring back and forth into another
store. In this example, the other store is gravitational potential energy as the pendulum rises to a
maximum height, where it has maximum GPE at each end of the swing and drops to minimum GPE as
it passes through the lowest point (the central position). These energy changes are shown in fig A.

A   fig
      A The energy in a simple harmonic oscillator is constantly being transferred from kinetic to potential and back
    again, whilst the total remains constant as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies at each moment.

Fig A could also apply to a mass bouncing on a spring. When stretched a little before release, the
spring has stored elastic potential energy. On release, the spring accelerates the mass back towards
the equilibrium position, where it has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential. This kinetic energy
is then transferred into elastic potential as the spring squashes in the other displacement direction.
The transfers of potential and kinetic energies continues, and if no energy can be lost from the
system it would oscillate with the same amplitude forever.

The above discussions are exclusively for a system that cannot lose any energy. The closest we can
get to this system would be a pendulum, or mass on a spring, in a vacuum. These would be almost
free from energy losses, but air resistance will act in most real situations.

                                      of 4.0 metres length, and its mass is 15 kg. A child of mass 45 kg swings on the tyre by pulling it 3.0 metres
                                      to one side (amplitude) and leaping on. What is the maximum height that the tyre reaches above its
                                      equilibrium position?

                                           A pendulum bob has a mass of 0.6 kg and a time period of 4 seconds. It is released from an amplitude
                                           Position of 5 cm. What is its kinetic energy after 8 seconds? What is its maximum kinetic energy?

                                      2.) If no energy were lost, a bungee jumper (as in fig C) would continue to oscillate up and down forever.
                                           Describe the energy changes the bungee jumper would undergo. Discuss kinetic energy, different
                                           types of potential energy, and the total energy. Conclude by explaining why in real life this does not
                                           happen.

                                      3.) Suggest how energy might be lost from a pendulum swinging in a vacuum.
                                      4.   Pendulum dynamics assumes that the oscillations are of a small amplitude compared with the length
                                           of the pendulum. The worked example of the forest tyre pendulum at the top of this page does not
                                           meet this assumption. Use a geometrical method to calculate the vertical height gained when the
                                           child holds the tyre at the 3 m horizontal amplitude quoted. Compare your answer with the 1.2m
                                           calculated in the worked example, and calculate the percentage difference between the two answers.

     Define the phenomenon of resonance.
     TM Describe how damping affects oscillations, how damping can be caused, and its uses
                             and implications.




FREE AND FORCED OSCILLATIONS
Releasing a pendulum from its maximum amplitude and letting it swing freely (preferably in a
vacuum) is an example of free oscillation. The situation is set up for a continuous exchange of
potential and kinetic energy, caused by a restoring force which is proportional to the displacement.
Any oscillating system has a natural frequency — the frequency at which it naturally chooses to
oscillate when left alone.

However, oscillators can be forced to behave in a different way to their natural motion. If, as a
pendulum swings one way, you push in the opposite direction, it turns back. By repeated applications
of forces from your hand in different directions, you could force the pendulum to oscillate at some
other frequency. This would then be forced oscillation — not SHM — and the frequency at which you
‘were causing it to swing at would be your driving frequency.

Forcing oscillations involves adding energy to a system whilst it oscillates. Unless this is done at the
natural frequency, the system is unlikely to undergo SHM and will dissipate the energy quite quickly.
This is what happens if you push a child on a swing at the wrong moment in the oscillation.


RESONANCE
If a system or object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency, it will absorb more and more energy,
resulting in very large amplitude oscillations. This is resonance. If your washing machine is very
noisy during one part of the wash cycle, the motor will be spinning at a certain frequency. This drives
vibrations in the machine at a frequency that is the natural frequency of one of the panels, which
then vibrates with very large amplitude, making a loud noise. During the rest of the wash, the motor's
rotation generates vibrations at other frequencies that do not match with the natural frequency of any
part of the machine, and it is much quieter.

                                  The set-up in fig B allows us to monitor the amplitude of vibrations of a mass on a spring, as we force it to
                                  vibrate at different frequencies. By monitoring for a very large amplitude of vibration, we can determine
                                   the resonant (or natural) frequency for the set-up.

                                   From previously, we know that a mass oscillating on a spring follows the equation for its time period:

                                   The time period will be the reciprocal of the natural frequency, f, and this is also the resonant frequency:

                                  DAMPED OSCILLATIONS
                                  Damped oscillations suffer a loss in energy in each oscillation and this reduces the amplitude over
                                  time (fig C).

                                  If a system is performing SHM at its natural frequency, its energy may be dissipated through a friction
                                  force acting on the system, or the plastic deformation of a ductile material in the system. If a pendulum
                                  is left to swing without interference, its amplitude will constantly decrease with each swing due to air
                                  resistance and internal stresses within the flexing material of the string. These effects can be amplified
                                  if we attach a small sail to catch the air This artificial increasing of the air resistance is an example of
                                  damping (or in fact an increase in the damping, as there would already be a tiny air resistance force on
                                  the pendulum). Note that although the amplitude decreases, the period remains constant throughout.

                                  The amount of damping may vary, which will change how quickly the amplitude is reduced. If the
                                  oscillator completes several oscillations, the amplitude will decrease exponentially. This is known
                                  as underdamping (sometimes called light damping). Swinging the pendulum in a bowl of water will
                                  make its amplitude of oscillation drop very rapidly, and it might not even complete one cycle. This is
                                  known as overdamping.

If the damping is such that the oscillator returns to its equilibrium position in the quickest possible
time, without going past that position (known as overshooting), then it is critically damped.
Overdamping is useful in many situations, such as car suspension systems, but too much
overdamping could cause the oscillator to take a very long time to return to its equilibrium position.
You can appreciate this if you imagine a pendulum swung through treacle — an extreme example of
overdamping.

new products and structures (fig F). Objects usually oscillate with large amplitudes at their natural
frequency, so this is the frequency at which these engineering solutions are most often aimed.
Creating damping systems that are a good balance between underdamping, critical damping and
severe overdamping is a tough problem for engineers in many real situations, especially as many
objects have several natural frequencies.

In some cases, the amplitude of resonant oscillations can be so great that they damage the system. This
is what happens when an opera singer breaks a wine glass by singing loudly at just the right pitch (fig G).

For some oscillators (e.g. clocks) we want minimum damping; whereas for others (e.g. a mountain
bike shock-absorbing system (fig H)) we want oscillations to stop as fast as possible. To make
this happen requires an exact damping system (‘critical damping’) so that the system returns to
equilibrium without overshooting.

Taipei 101 is a 100-storey skyscraper. It was designed to be safe in a number of extreme conditions, including very strong winds and
earthquakes. Near the top of the building, there is a system to reduce the effects of resonance from these conditions.




 ONLINE INFORMATION



TUNED MASS DAMPER (TMD)
The complete name of the TAIPEI 101 wind damper is the tuned
mass damper (TMD). The TMD has been specifically designed
as a passive damper system and is positioned at the center of
the tower between the 87th and 92nd floors. Its main purpose
is to reduce the swaying of the tower during strong winds and
eliminate any resulting discomfort experienced by anyone within
the building. Unlike conventional damper systems that are
usually hidden from public view, special functional and aesthetic
considerations have been made for the TAIPEI 101 wind damper
so that visitors can take a look at the entire wind damper system
and see how it operates at the Observatory.

to support the ball, while eight viscous dampers act like shock
absorbers when the sphere shifts. The ball can move 5 ft. in any
direction and reduce sways by 40 percent. Two additional tuned
mass dampers, each weighing 7 tons, installed at the tip of the
spire provide additional protection against strong wind loads.

       of the skyscraper?
   (b) Why would the skyscraper suffer different variations of this problem with different wind
       speeds?

   (c) Why are large movements of the building a problem?
   (d) Explain how an earthquake could also cause a similar problem, including similarities and
      differences with swaying caused by the wind.
3 (a) How does this mass damper stop the building from swaying too much? Explain the
       physics principles behind it.
   (b) Why is the damper positioned so high up the building, around the 90th floor?

TOPIC 11 ASTROPHYSICS AND
         COSMOLOGY


Gravity is one of the most obvious scientific phenomena and we have studied it for a very long time. When
you drop a pen you can see gravity and its effects clearly and we know how to utilise these in very precise
ways.


In November 2014, the European Space Agency landed a probe on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
This may not sound remarkable. We have landed probes on the Moon, Mars, other planets and moons of
other planets. However, the size and mass of this comet means that the gravitational field is so weak that it
would be difficult to create a centripetal force of attraction on the probe which would allow orbiting. The ESA
had to ensure that the lander was travelling at less than one metre per second, and even then the lander
bounced significantly.

However, gravity remains one of the least well-understood areas of physics. There are a number of
experiments currently ongoing to try and observe some of the theoretical explanations of how gravity works
ona     fundamental level. As yet, none have been conclusive, but as their sensitivity improves, scientists hope
that we will be able to collect enough experimental evidence to confirm how gravity works. Gravity waves,
quantum gravity and so-called strong gravity are current areas of interest to cutting-edge physicists.

Volcanology is the study of volcanoes. The importance of detailed scientific research into the development and explosions of
volcanoes was highlighted by the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajékull in Iceland, which closed much of Europe's airspace for nearly a week.

The extract below is a section from the book Jntroducing Volcanology. It explains how internal changes within a volcano can be monitored
by their effects on the local gravitational field strength. These internal changes might be early signs that an eruption will occur

A general survey of the gross volcanic structure using gravity

may relate to the presence of dense or light bodies beneath the

structure. Gravity measurements may also be used to get much
closer to understanding what’s happening in the magma plumbing
before and even during eruptions. To do this a technique known
as microgravity provides much more necessary detail. This is
a geophysical technique that can measure minute changes in
the Earth’s gravity. It must be corrected to take account of any
ground movements that are occurring at the same time, as these
will have an effect on the overall gravity measurement. Filling
of a magma chamber with new magma, or the vesiculation of an
existing magma reservoir, prior to eruption, will change the density
of the surroundings and can be picked up with microgravity.
Electromagnetic fields (EM) are also used to provide quite a                                                               19.6"         -19.4"          -19.2"

These measurements, when combined with other remote sensing
techniques, can be very powerful tools with which to monitor the

CHAPTER




          Humans have always wondered at the stars in the night sky. Stories from long ago about constellations,
          paintings and recent photographs, have all added to the mystery.

          Scientists have applied the usual techniques of measurement and evidence-seeking to the studies of
          astronomy and astrophysics. It is remarkable how much information we have gained about the stars, galaxies
          and the Universe as a whole, from only the light that lands on us from these distant celestial bodies. We can
          use this information to infer the existence of many things we cannot see. Most of the Universe is dark energy
          and dark matter, and although we cannot detect either of these, starlight can tell us they are there and
          affecting everything in the Universe.

          In this chapter, we will look at how stars emit energy as electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths, and
          what we can find out from the measurements of this radiation when it arrives at the Earth. We will see how to
          determine the distance to a star, how hot it is, what type of star it is, what made of, and also much more.

To calculate luminosity, we needed to know the temperature of the
star There are various methods for determining the temperatures
of stars, but we will focus on one that uses the wavelengths of light
given off by a star When we examine the range of wavelengths
emitted by a star, known as its spectrum, we find that some
wavelengths are given off with more intensity than others.

                                    STAR CLASSES
                                    Astronomers have classified stars into groups according to their temperature. This is a useful
                                    property to use since stars with similar temperatures tend to share many other features. As we saw
                                    from Wien’s law (see fig E in Section 11B.1) the temperature determines the spectral output of the
                                    star, but it can also suggest chemical composition and age.

                                    The spectral star classes are labelled by letters (table A). One mnemonic for remembering the

                                           Only Brilliant Astronomers Fix Grave Kepler Mistakes

                                    You will notice a number of trends in the data in table A. The hotter stars often have more mass
                                    and are more luminous. The larger gravitational pressure at the centre of a massive star makes
                                    the nuclear fusion reactions within the star run very fast, producing a lot of energy and using the
                                    hydrogen fuel in the star at a very high rate. In addition, more massive stars are also larger. Therefore,
                                    with large size and high temperatures, the hotter stars are very luminous, giving off a lot of energy. At
                                    the same distance away from us, these will then appear very bright in the night sky compared with a
                                    smaller, cooler star.

                                    Table A also shows the change in colour that goes along with changing stellar class. The overall
                                    impression of the O class spectrum is a bluish colour, whereas for the M class spectrum there is
                                    a strong red colour showing (also see fig A). These changes are a direct result of the variation in
                                    output curve we saw associated with Wien’s law. Fig B highlights how this comes about.

A.   fig
       A Light spectra from typical stars in each star class. Note the white lines, which highlight the position of
     absorption lines (actually black in the original photos). These give us information about the chemical composition of
     the     stars, and the Doppler shift which tells us their velocity.

Looking at fig B, if we combine together equal intensity parts of the colours of the visible spectrum,
this will produce white light. The extra emissions above this white basic emission — the peak of the
curve on the graph — will show the colour the star appears. Also, given the pattern of decreasing size
with luminosity we have seen above, it is logical to find that blue supergiants are generally O class
stars, whereas red dwarf stars are usually in the M class.

                                   THE HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL DIAGRAM
                                   If you plot a graph of luminosity against star temperature to confirm the trend of table A, you
                                   will find that there is a general correlation. However, the more data you add, the more complex the
                                   picture becomes. We must also remember that the temperature measurement assumes the star
                                   behaves as a black body, and the luminosity is similarly often not as accurate as we would like. In
                                   general, luminosity has to be determined from a calculation that includes the distance to the star,
                                   and measuring the distances to stars is by no means an exact science (see Section 11B.3 for more
                                   details). Such a plot can give us some very useful insights, but is not a graph in the true sense. It is
                                   known as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (fig C).

                                   Most stars we observe fall on a diagonal line across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which is called
                                   the main sequence. These main sequence stars are stable stars which will exist in this state for
                                   the majority of their lifetime. Their correlation represents the connection between brightness and
                                   high temperature. Note that the plot is always drawn with hotter temperatures on the left-hand side.
                                   There are also other stages in a star's evolution, which appear in other places on the diagram, but
                                   these are much shorter than its stable period. Thus there are far fewer stars in those parts of the H-R

BIG DISTANCE UNITS
Astronomical distances are very large. Our nearest neighbour is the Moon, and even that is nearly
400 000 000 m away. The Sun is 150 000 000 000
                                             m away, and the distance to the orbit of Neptune
is 4 500 000 000 000 m. Measuring across space generates very large values. Using standard form
notation helps with this, but astronomers have defined a number of alternative distance units to cut
down the magnitudes of the numbers involved.

You have probably already heard of the light year. This is the distance that light can travel in one
year, which is about 10°m. We also use the astronomical unit (AU), which is the radius of the
Earth’s orbit around the Sun: 1 AU = 1.5 x 10''m.

Much of our understanding of the structure and formation of galaxies depends on being able to
measure the distances to stars accurately. Astronomers have developed a number of techniques for
doing this, but all have their limitations. These limitations can be overcome, or at least minimised, by
comparing the results from the different techniques on the same star, and refining the techniques to
improve accuracy.

 LEARNING TIP
 Some of the techniques explained in this section are used on individual stars, and some are used on large
 groups of stars, such as galaxies or star clusters.



TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX
To measure the distance to relatively close stars, astronomers use a method which is commonly used
in surveying, known as trigonometric parallax. As the Earth moves around the Sun, a relatively
close star will appear to move across the background of more distant stars. This optical illusion is
used to determine the distance of the star The star itself does not move significantly during the
course of the observations. To determine the trigonometric parallax you measure the angle to a star,
and observe how that changes as the position of the Earth changes. We know that in six months the
Earth will be exactly on the opposite side of its orbit, and therefore will be two astronomical units
from its location today.

Using observations of the star which is to be measured against a background of much more distant
stars, we can measure the angle between the star and the Earth in these two different positions in
space, six months apart. As we know the size of the Earth’s orbit, geometry allows calculation of the
distance to the star.

The accuracy of trigonometric parallax depends on the accuracy of the angle measurement.
With atmospheric interference for Earth-based telescopes, this was for many years limited to
stellar distances of about 100 light years. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission is an
orbiting telescope, which has an accuracy in the angle measurement of 24 microarcseconds. This
corresponds to allowing accurate distance measurement to stars as far away as 135 000 light years.
Section 11B.4 also highlights how important it is to know stellar distances accurately.

                                   THE DOPPLER EFFECT
                                   Astronomers first began to look at the spectra of stars in other galaxies during the 1920s. They
                                   noticed that the spectra looked very similar to the spectra from stars in our own galaxy but that all
                                   the features present were shifted by the same relative amount towards the red end of the spectrum.
                                   This phenomenon became known as the red shift. This shift is due to the relative motion of other
                                   galaxies with respect to ours, in an effect called the Doppler effect: an observer receiving waves
                                   emitted from a moving body observes that the wavelength of the waves has been altered to a new
                                  wavelength.

A star or galaxy moving away emits light that appears to have a longer wavelength than expected.
We also experience this effect when, for example, we hear a car coming towards us and driving past
at a steady rate (fig A). As it approaches, the note of its engine rises to a maximum pitch, and then
falls as the car travels away. You could imagine the waves getting squashed closer together (shorter
wavelength) as the car drives towards you, and then stretched further apart (longer wavelength) as it
drives away.

The amount of red shift a galaxy exhibits, z, allows us to calculate how fast it is moving. This can be
done using measurements of either wavelength or frequency changes (fig B).




 WORKED EXAMPLE 1
 In a laboratory sample, the hydrogen alpha spectral absorption line is at a wavelength of 656.285
 nanometres. In the spectrum from a nearby star, this line is observed at a wavelength of 656.315 nm. How
 fast is this star moving and in which direction?

 The wavelength from the star is longer than it should be, so the star is moving away.

                                    Astronomers quickly realised that red shift implied that galaxies surrounding us were travelling away
                                    from us. In 1929 the American astronomer Edwin Hubble published his finding that the value of a
                                    galaxy’s red shift is proportional to its distance from us — that is, the further away a galaxy is, the faster
                                    it is moving. Hubble’s paper had the same effect on the twentieth century view of the Universe as
                                    Galileo's work on the solar system had some 300 years earlier. Instead of being static, the Universe was
                                    expanding. The philosophical implications continue to intrigue scientists and religious scholars
                                    (see Section 11B.5).

                                                                                      in their    spectra, Hubble   concluded that

                                               apart from each other and the Universe is expanding.

                                    Considering the speeds of galaxies and their distances, there is a simple relationship between them. This
                                    is known as Hubble’s law:

                                                 v= Hyd

                                    So, the velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to the distance to it. We can find the constant
                                    of proportionality, the Hubble constant, from the gradient of the graph in fig D. This has had
                                    many values over the years, which demonstrates the immense difficulties involved in accurately
                                    determining astronomical distances. Since the launch of the ESA Planck Surveyor, the uncertainty
                                    in measurements and so the uncertainty in the Hubble constant has reduced significantly, and data
                                    from the Gaia survey will improve it even more. The current value is considered accurate to within

     the possible existence of dark matter.



                                   THE HUBBLE CONSTANT
                                   In Section 11B.4 we saw that there might be a variation in values of the Hubble constant depending
                                   on the observational methods used to find it. This is a very significant and important problem, as it
                                   can give a huge variation in possible ages for our Universe. Over the years, the Universe’s age based
                                   on Hubble’s law calculations has given answers ranging from 10 billion to 20 billion years. Table A
                                   shows a 2014 summary of recent experimental conclusions that indicate a slightly lower value for
                                   Ah than the currently accepted 70.9kms~'Mpc"'. Further observations are needed to confirm these
                                   newer results before scientists will agree to change Ho. The result of all of this is that we do not have a
                                   fixed answer for the age of our Universe, but this keeps changing as experimental methods improve.

                                   FUTURE UNIVERSE?
                                   The Universe is expanding. Will this change in the future? The answer to this question depends
                                   critically on the mass of the Universe, and more specifically on the density of matter. Gravity is
                                   the force that could slow the expansion down to a stop, and possibly even then start to cause the
                                   Universe to contract back inwards (fig A). This might eventually end in a Big Crunch. The force of
                                   gravity between particles decreases with the square of the distance. This means that, if the matter
                                   in the Universe is low density, then the gravitational forces between particles, stars and galaxies
                                   will be generally weak. The Universe will continue expanding forever. However, if the matter in the
                                   Universe has more than a critical density then the gravitational forces will succeed in causing the
                                   Big Crunch.

DARK MATTER
To determine the future of the Universe, scientists have been trying to work out its density. However,
they have hit upon some big problems. In the 1960s and 1970s, American astronomer Vera Rubin made
observations of many galaxies and found a very unexpected result. The stars in the galaxies usually
rotate at similar speeds, whatever their distance from the galactic centre. This is completely different to
the Solar System, in which the further planets from the Sun orbit much more slowly than those close in.

Galaxies emit an amount of light. We can measure this by measuring their apparent brightness and
calculating the inverse square decrease in this which is caused by the distance to the galaxy. From
the actual luminosity of a galaxy, we can estimate the mass of all its stars. Galaxies rotate and this
means that all the stars they contain must be experiencing a centripetal force towards the centre of
the galaxy’s rotation. When astronomers measure the rotational speed of the stars in the galaxies,                         A   fig B Vera Rubin's discovery of
they find that the mass suggested by the luminosity calculations is not nearly enough to create the                            unexpected orbital speeds for
centripetal force needed to keep the galaxy spinning (fig C). In fact, the mass of the stars is generally                      stars in the Andromeda galaxy

Astronomers have not yet discovered what the dark matter could be. Most stars will have a planetary
system, but the mass of all these planets is not nearly enough to hold a galaxy together. Black holes
or interstellar gases are good candidates for dark matter, but these (and other similar suggestions) are
also not observed in sufficient quantities. We can account for some dark matter with straightforward
things such as these, but scientists are convinced that the majority of dark matter is of a different but
as yet unknown form.

GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
Einstein's theory of gravity explains that large masses will deform space-time — the fabric of the
Universe — so that it accelerates things. This is quite different from Newton’s explanation of gravity as
a force. The curving of space-time predicts that the direction of travel of light will be affected. Very
large masses, such as galaxies or black holes, will cause a bending of light in a similar way as passing
through a lens. This effect has been widely observed in photographs of deep space (fig D).

The European Space Agency (ESA) has a space telescope mission called Euclid, for the study of dark energy, gravity and dark matter.
These are high-level physics concepts and are not often explained simply for children. The webpage shown here comes from a website
called Our Universe for Kids.




OUR EXPANDING UNIVERSE
Dark energy and dark matter are not the same. One is matter and
the other is energy, but they are both dark, and just like dark matter
while it’s believed that dark energy is there and does exist, as its
believed that there is some evidence of this, the energy cannot be
completely proven and confirmed.

Gravity plays an important part in the existence of dark energy and
also dark matter, and that is how this phenomenon is measured.
                                                                             billion years)




Scientists believe that dark matter makes up about 25% of the
universe, with dark energy making up all but the rest at about 70%.
That means that only 5% of the visual matter such as the stars,                                                          Farthest

planets and gas clouds makes up the entire universe. That’s pretty
amazing when you think about it.

So, dark energy is believed to make up around two thirds of
basically everything in the universe and we still know almost                                     <
                                                                                                                    Expanding universe

Again just like dark matter, we know almost for sure that it’s there,
and in time we will figure out more about this type of energy, that’s
for sure. It might turn out to be somewhat different, but we are on
the right track.

MATHS SKILLS
      For you to be able to develop your skills, knowledge and understanding in Physics, you will also need
      to develop your mathematical skills in several key areas. This section gives more explanation and
      examples of some key mathematical concepts you need to understand. Further examples relevant to
      your International A Level Physics studies are given throughout this book and in Book 1 (IAS).


      ARITHMETIC AND NUMERICAL COMPUTATION
      USING LOGARITHMS
      Many formulae in science and mathematics involve powers. Consider the equation:

            10*
             = 62

      We know that the value of x lies between 1 and 2, but how can we find a precise answer? The term
      logarithm means index or power, and logarithms allow us to solve such equations. We can take the
      ‘logarithm base 10’ of each side using the log button of a calculator.


       WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                10" = 62

                logio(10+) = log;o(62)
                x= 1.792392...


      We can calculate the logarithm using any number as the base by using the log-(X) button.


       WORKED EXAMPLE 2
                a7

                log,(2") = log,(7)
                x= 2.807355...


      Many equations relating to the natural world involve powers of e. We call these exponentials.
      The logarithm base e is referred to as the natural logarithm and denoted as In.

      There are three laws of logarithms, which are derived from the laws of indices:

      log a + log b= log ab          (addition rule)

      loga—logb=loga/b               (subtraction rule)

      log a" = nloga                 (power rule)


       WORKED EXAMPLE 3
       Using the equation N = No eTM, calculate the decay constant for a substance that has a half-life of 3 years.

                    In) = -3A

                =) 9231.
       Note that the units for this answer will be years”.

GRAPHS
USING LOGARITHMIC PLOTS
An earthquake which measures 8.0 on the Richter scale is much more than twice as powerful as an
earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale. This is because the units which are used to measure
earthquakes use the concept of logarithm scales in charts and graphs. This helps us to accommodate
enormous increases (or decreases) in one variable as another variable changes.

SKETCHING MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
It is helpful to be familiar with standard mathematical functions when modelling physical
relationships.

Sine and cosine functions

Remember the following facts about the sine and cosine functions:
¢ Both functions oscillate between 1 and -1.
© The sine function can be translated 90 degrees to the left to produce the cosine function.
© Each curve repeats itself every 360 degrees (called the period of 360 degrees).
     Each function carries on to positive infinity and minus infinity.

THE AREA BETWEEN A CURVE AND THE x-AXIS
The area between a curve and the x-axis was interesting to Sir Isaac Newton and was one of the
key concepts that led him to develop the techniques of differentiation and integration. Newton
demonstrated that it was possible to find the area between a curve and the axis using an innovative
method of summing up strips of area between two distinct limits of the curve.

For many graphs, this area has physical significance:

© The area beneath the curve of a velocity—time graph is equivalent to distance travelled.

© The area under a voltage—charge graph is equivalent to the energy stored for a capacitor.

      G The area between the x-axis and the curve can be estimated by summing up the area of strips. Smaller strips
    give a more accurate answer.




GEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY
USING RADIANS

One theory for how the degree was chosen as a unit of rotation is that Babylonian astronomers used
observations of the night sky to estimate an impressively close 360 days as the number of days ina
year. A degree was defined as aa of a full rotation, meaning that a full rotation contains 360 degrees.
When working with trigonometric functions and calculus, it can be much simpler to use radians. A

radian is defined as - of a full rotation, so a full rotation contains 2n radians. (You can read more
about radians in Section 5B.1.)

      2m rad = 360°

        mrad = 180°

        1 rad = 57.296°


 WORKED EXAMPLE 4
 Convert:

    (a) 32 radians into degrees
    (b) 60° into radians.

    (a) 3m radians = 3 x 180 degrees = 540 degrees

    (b) 60 degrees = 60 (eal) radians = g radians.


 LEARNING TIP
 When using a calculator to calculate sin x, cos x and tan x, make sure your calculator is set up to use the
 angle unit that you need. Most calculators will show ‘D' or ‘DEG’ on the display when in degree mode and
 ‘R or ‘RAD’ when in radian mode.

                        (a) You should be able to deduce the shape of the graph from the equation. Note that:

                                 against time. (To calculate the charge stored you can either perform an integration, which is
                                 beyond the scope of the specification, or you can measure the area using the scales on the axes
                                 and by counting squares. You will find Q = EC.)


                        (c) Take logarithm base e of the original equation: | = Ip eY*°

                                 So, if we plot In/ on the y-axis and t on the x-axis, the gradient will be given by m = a and since
                                 this is a constant the gradient of the graph will be constant and the line will be straight

Question analysis

e    Short open questions usually require simple short answers,
     often one word. Generally, they will require simple recall
     of the physics you have been taught.

e The command word will tell you what you need to do.
     When the question is a ‘show that’ as here, it is important
     that your answer shows the examiner every step in the
     derivation (or calculation, if that is what is asked).

e The last step in the derivation is the equation shown in the
     question (it is also on the Formulae sheet), so you must
     show two other steps to score the marks.

e The question asks for recall of two terms used in wave
        analysis, and around a third of the overall marks will be
        awarded for demonstrating knowledge and understanding.

e There are two marks for stating what the terms mean;
        there is a mark for identifying the physics relating the

    e The number of wavelengths gives the phase difference.                  then tries to explain the connection.


COMMENTARY
This is a weak answer because:
e The path difference is explained in terms of the difference
        in the distance travelled and gets the first mark.

e The phase difference is not explained using any new words;
        it simply uses words from the question in a different order,
        which will not score any marks.

e The connection between the two terms is to do with
        wavelength, but the answer is too vague about how this
        connection works. The answer should mention what
        fraction of a wavelength the path difference leaves.

Question analysis
e    In questions marked with an asterisk (*), marks will
     be awarded for your ability to structure your answers
     logically showing how the points that you make are related
     or follow on from each other where appropriate.
e    Marks will be awarded at different levels, where the
     highest band (5-6 marks in this case) will only be given if
     the answer demonstrates comprehensive understanding,
     uses relevant knowledge of physical concepts and has an
     explanation that is clear, coherent and logically structured.
e    Itis vital to plan out your answer before you write it
     down. There is always space given on an exam paper to
     do this, so write down the points that you want to make
     before you answer the question in the space provided.
     This will help to ensure that your answer is coherent and
     logical, and that you don’t end up contradicting yourself.
     However, once you have written your answer, go back and
     draw a line through these notes so that it is clear they do
     not form part of the answer.

    Lenz’s law tells us that that any change is opposed, and                  is some sort of linkage between the points but it is weak.
    this is just the conservation ofenergy in action.


COMMENTARY
This is a weak answer because:
e     Itis important to use A level concepts and terms when
     answering at this level.
e    The question asks for an explanation using the equation
     but the answer does not do that. Faraday’s law should be
     applied to the changing magnetic flux. There should be a
     statement about the effect of the number of coils, which
     should also be explained.
e Whilst the comment about Lenz’s law is true, it has no
     relation to the question.
e There is almost no linkage between the points made.

e The use ofquantity algebra ensures that the candidate
     realises that the number at the end of the second line is an
     area — unit is m?— and so cannot be the answer, which is a
     length, the radius of the star.

e The equation is copied out from the Formulae sheet and
     then re-arranged. This helps to get the letters in the correct

e The numbers are substituted into the re-arranged equation
     with units.
e The final number is calculated and so is the final unit.

COMMENTARY
This is a fairly weak answer because:
e    The answer uses conservation of momentum quite well
     in the first part, especially since momentum is a vector
     and travelling in a straight line indicates no ‘sideways’
     momentum and therefore no other particle.
e    There is a weak link between the mass and the energy

     produced in the decay, but it is not developed.
e    Conservation of momentum is cited but not really used in
     the explanation, and the fact that the initial momentum is
     zero is not used.
e    The link between mass and velocity is weak, and as it is the
     key to the second part this will not score full marks.
