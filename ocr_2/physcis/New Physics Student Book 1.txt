In order to ensure that this resource offers high-quality support for the associated
Pearson qualification, it has been through a review process by the awarding
body. This process confirmed that this resource fully covers the teaching and
learning content of the specification at which it is aimed. It also confirms that it
demonstrates an appropriate balance between the development of subject skills,
knowledge and understanding, in addition to preparation for assessment.


Endorsement does not cover any guidance on assessment activities or processes
(e.g. practice questions or advice on how to answer assessment questions)
included in the resource, nor does it prescribe any particular approach to the
teaching or delivery of a related course.


While the publishers have made every attempt to ensure that advice on the
qualification and its assessment is accurate, the official specification and
associated assessment guidance materials are the only authoritative source of
information and should always be referred to for definitive guidance.


Pearson examiners have not contributed to any sections in this resource relevant to
examination papers for which they have responsibility.


Examiners will not use endorsed resources as a source of material for any
assessment set by Pearson. Endorsement of a resource does not mean that the
resource is required to achieve this Pearson qualification, nor does it mean that
it is the only suitable material available to support the qualification, and any
resource lists produced by the awarding body shall include this and other
appropriate resources.

            ABOUT THIS BOOK
            This book is written for students following the Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary (IAS)
             Physics specification. This book covers the full IAS course and the first year of the International A Level
            (IAL) course.

            The book contains full coverage of IAS units (or exam papers) 1 and 2. Each unit in the specification has
            two topic areas. The topics in this book, and their contents, fully match the specification. You can refer to
            the Assessment Overview on page X for further information. Students can prepare for the written Practical
            Skills Paper (unit 3) by using the IAL Physics Lab Book (see page viii of this book).

             Each Topic is divided into chapters and sections to break the content down into manageable chunks. Each
            section features a mix of learning and activities.

       PRACTICAL SKILLS
       Practical work is central to the study of physics. The Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary (IAS) Physics
       specification includes eight Core Practicals that link theoretical knowledge and understanding to practical scenarios.

       Your knowledge and understanding of practical skills and activities will be assessed in all examination papers for the
       IAS Level Physics qualification.

       e    Papers 1 and 2 will include questions based on practical activities, including novel scenarios.

       e    Paper 3 will test your ability to plan practical work, including risk management and selection of apparatus.

       In order to develop practical skills, you should carry out a range of practical experiments related to the topics covered in
       your course. Further suggestions in addition to the Core Practicals are included below.

         ADVANCED SUBSIDIARY
Throughout your study of physics, you will develop knowledge and understanding of what it
means to work scientifically. You will develop confidence in key scientific skills, such as handling
and controlling quantities and units and making estimates. You will also learn about the ways in
which the scientific community functions and how society as a whole uses scientific ideas.

At the end of each chapter in this book, there is a section called Thinking Bigger. These sections
are based broadly on the content of the chapter just completed, but they will also draw on your
previous learning from earlier in the course or from your previous studies and point towards
future learning and less familiar contexts. The Thinking Bigger sections will also help you to
develop transferable skills. By working through these sections, you will:
* read real-life scientific writing in a variety of contexts and aimed at different audiences
* develop an understanding of how the professional scientific community functions
* learn to think critically about the nature of what you have read
* understand the issues, problems and challenges that may be raised
* gain practice in communicating information and ideas in an appropriate scientific way
* apply your knowledge and understanding to unfamiliar contexts.

You will also gain scientific skills through the hands-on practical work that forms an essential part of
your course. As well as understanding the experimental methods of the practicals, it is important
that you develop the skills necessary to plan experiments and analyse and evaluate data. Not only
are these very important scientific skills, but they will be assessed in your examinations.



MATHS SKILLS FOR PHYSICISTS
*   Recognise and make use of appropriate units in calculations (e.g. knowing the difference between
    base and derived units)
    Estimate results (e.g. estimating the speed of waves on the sea)
    Make order of magnitude calculations (e.g. estimating approximately what an answer should be
    before you start calculating, including using standard form)
    Use algebra to rearrange and solve equations (e.g. finding the landing point of a projectile)
    Recognise the importance of the straight line graph as an analysis tool for the verification and
    development of physical laws by experimentation (e.g. choosing appropriate variables to plot to
    generate a straight line graph with experimental data)
    Determine the slope and intercept of a linear graph (e.g. finding acceleration from a velocity-time
    graph)
    Calculate the area under the line on a graph (e.g. finding the energy stored in a stretched wire)
    Use geometry and trigonometry (e.g. finding components of vectors)

   figA The international standard kilogram, officially known as the
    International Prototype Kilogram, is made from a mixture of platinum and
    iridium and is held at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures in
    Paris. All other masses are defined by comparing with this metal cylinder.

Some measurements we make are of fundamental qualities of
things in the universe. For example, the length of a pencil is
a fundamental property of the object. Compare this with the
pencil’s speed if you drop it. To give a value to the speed, we
have to consider a distance moved, and the rate of motion over
that distance — we also need to measure time and then do a
calculation. You can see that there is a fundamental difference
between the types of quantity that are length and speed. We
call the length a base unit, whilst the speed is a derived unit. At
present, the international scientific community uses seven base
units, and from these all other units are derived. Some derived
units have their own names. For example, the derived unit of force                   fig B   A standard metre, made to be exactly the length that light could

derived units do not get their own name, and we just list the base
units that went together in deriving the quantity. For example,
speed is measured in ms~’.

In many situations, physicists are not interested in specific
answers, as circumstances can vary slightly and then the specific
answer is incorrect. An order of magnitude answer will always
be correct, unless you change the initial conditions by more than
an order of magnitude. So a physicist could easily answer the
question ‘What is the fastest speed of a car?’ because we don't
really want to know the exact true value. To give an exact answer
would depend on knowing the model of car, and the weather and
road conditions, and this answer would only be correct for that       A   figB    Enrico Fermi was one of the developers of both nuclear reactors

solving Fermi questions.
TOPIC 1 MECHANICS
CHAPTER




          1A
      How can we calculate how fast a plane is flying, in what direction it is going and how long it will take to reacha
     certain destination? If you were a pilot, how would you know what force to make the engines produce and
     where to direct that force so your plane moves to your destination?

     An incredible number of intricate calculations need to be done to enable a successful flight, and the basis for all
     of them is simple mechanics.

     This chapter explains the multiple movements of objects. It looks at how movement can be described and
     recorded, and then moves on to explaining why movement happens. It covers velocity and acceleration,
     including how to calculate these in different situations.

     We only consider objects moving at speeds that could be encountered in everyday life. At these speeds (much
     less than the speed of light) Sir Isaac Newton succinctly described three laws of motion. With knowledge of basic
     geometry, we can identify aspects of movement in each dimension.

      Newton's laws of motion have been constantly under test by scientists ever since he published them in 1687.
     Within the constraints established by Einstein in the early twentieth century, Newton's laws have always
     correctly described the relationships between data collected. You may have a chance to confirm Newton's laws
     in experiments of your own. With modern ICT recording of data, the reliability of such experiments is now much
     improved over traditional methods.

                                    Movement is fundamental to the functioning of our universe. Whether you are running to catch a
                                    bus or want to calculate the speed required for a rocket to travel to Mars or the kinetic energy of an
                                    electron in an X-ray machine, you need to be able to work out how fast things are moving.


                                    RATE OF MOVEMENT
                                    One of the simplest things we can measure is how fast an object is moving. You can calculate an
                                    object’s speed if you know the amount of time taken to move a certain distance:

                                                           distance (m)
                                          speed (ms-') =     ame)

                                    However, the calculation for speed will only tell you how fast an object is moving. Often it is also
                                    vitally important to know in what direction this movement is taking the object. When you include
                                    the direction in the information about the rate of movement of an object, this is then known as the

used here to calculate the
velocity of the object.

                                        velocity due north is much less than the actual speed.


                                    A quantity for which the direction must be stated is known as a vector. If direction is not important,
LEARNING TIP                        the measurement is referred to as a scalar quantity. Therefore, velocity is a vector and speed is a
                                    scalar; distance is a scalar and displacement is a vector.

                                       There is another method for finding the resultant of two non-perpendicular forces (or vectors) by
                                       scale drawing, which can be easier to use. This is called the parallelogram rule. Draw the two vectors
                                       to scale — at the correct angle and scaled so their length represents the magnitude — starting from
                                       the same point. Then draw the same two vectors again parallel to the original ones, so that they form
                                       a parallelogram, as shown in fig F. The resultant force (or vector) will be the diagonal across the
                                       parallelogram from the starting point.

                                        The vector addition rules shown on these pages work for all vectors, not just forces. They are useful only for
                                        co-planar vectors, which means vectors that are in the same plane. If we have more than two vectors that
                                        are in more than one plane, add two vectors together first, in their plane, and then add the resultant to the
                                        next vector using these rules again. Keep doing this until all the vectors have been added in.

Forces on an object could act so that the object does not start to
move along, but instead rotates about a fixed pivot. If the object is
fixed so that it cannot rotate, it will bend.

                                          The centre of gravity of an irregularly shaped object will still follow the rule that it is the point at
                                          which its weight appears to act on the object. A Bunsen burner, for example, has a heavy base.
                                          As such, the centre of gravity is low down near that concentration of mass, as there will be a greater
                                          attraction by the Earth’s gravity to this large mass.

PRACTICAL SKILLS
Finding the centre of mass of an irregular rod
In this investigation, we use the principle of moments to find the centre of gravity of a broom. It is not easy
to estimate/determine the (location of the) centre of gravity by looking at a broom because it is not a
symmetrical object. With the extra mass at the brush head end, the centre of gravity will be nearer that end.
lf you can balance the broom on the edge of a thick metal ruler, then the centre of gravity must lie above
the ruler edge. As the perpendicular distance from the line of action to the weight is zero, the moment is
zero so the broom sits in equilibrium.
You will probably find it difficult to balance the broom exactly, so you can use an alternative method. First
you measure the mass of the broom (M) using a digital balance. Then you use a set of hanging masses (of
mass m) to balance the broom more in the middle of the handle, as in fig G. When the broom is balanced,
you measure the distance (d) from the hanging masses to the pivot. You calculate the distance (x) from the
pivot to the centre of gravity of the broom using the principle of moments:
       clockwise moment = anticlockwise moment
                   mg x          d=Mg xx
                                 _md
                            Xx
                                 ~M
Note: Do not get into the habit of using only the mass in moments calculations, as the definition is force
times distance. It just happens that in this case g cancels on each side.




  Safety Note: Securely clamp the base of the stand to the bench. Do not use a very heavy broom as you
  would need a heavier counterweight which could fall and cause injury.

Experimental verification of Newton's second law is well established. The investigation shown in fig C demonstrates that: a = —


 LEARNING TIP
Straight-line graphs

Physicists always try to arrange their experimental data into graphs that produce a straight best-fit line. This proves a linear relationship between
the experimental variables, and can also give us numerical information about the quantities involved.
The equation for a straight line is:

       y=mx+c


‘m’ in the equation is the gradient of the straight line, and ‘c’ is the value on the y-axis where the line crosses it, known as the y-intercept.

If we plot experimental data on a graph and get a straight best-fit line, then this proves the quantities we plotted on x and y have a linear
relationship. It is referred to as ‘directly proportional’ (or simply ‘proportional’) only if the line also passes through the origin, meaning that c = 0.

The graphs in fig D and fig E demonstrate experimental verification of Newton's second law. In each case, the third variable in the equation was
kept constant as a control variable. For example, in fig D the straight best-fit line, showing that y « x, proves that a « F, and the gradient of the
best-fit line would represent the reciprocal of the mass that was accelerated and was kept constant throughout, as a control variable. In this
example c = 0, which means that the proportional relationships are simple:

                                    As both the above equations represent the graph in fig D, it follows that the gradient, m, equals the
                                    reciprocal of the mass, 1/m. It is just coincidence that the symbol ‘m’ for gradient, and ‘m’ for mass are the
                                    same letter in this example.
                                    Note that graphs in physics are causal relationships. In fig D, the acceleration is caused by the force. It is
                                    very rare in physics that a graph would represent a statistical correlation, and so phrases such as ‘positive
                                    correlation’ do not correctly describe graphs of physics experiments.
                                    Similarly, it is very rare that a graph of a physics experiment would be correctly drawn if the points are
                                    joined ‘dot-to-dot’. In most cases a best-fit line should be drawn, as has been donein fig E.

Compare this equation with the equation for a straight-line graph:
      y=mx+c


We plot a graph of h on the x-axis and t? on the y-axis to give a
straight best-fit line. The gradient of the line on this graph will be 2/g,
from which we can find g.

We could find a value for g by taking a single measurement from this
experiment and using the equation to calculate it:




However, a single measurement in any experiment is subject to
uncertainty from both random and systematic errors. We can reduce
such uncertainties significantly by taking many readings and plotting
a graph, which leads to much more reliable conclusions.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 M@ Apply kinematics equations to moving objects.
 M@ Apply the independence of horizontal and vertical
     motion to objects moving freely under gravity.
 M Combine horizontal and vertical motion to calculate
     the movements of projectiles.


Objects thrown or fired through the air generally follow projectile
motion. Here we are going to combine ideas from the various
earlier sections in order to solve questions about projectiles.
Resolving vectors showed that the actions in each of two
perpendicular directions are wholly independent. This means we
can use Newton's laws of motion and the kinematics equations
separately for the horizontal and vertical motions of the same object.
This will allow us to calculate its overall motion in two dimensions.

We only consider the motion after the force projecting an object has         A   figA Vertical acceleration on a horizontally moving stone.

the vertical component of velocity is initially zero, but the stone
accelerates under gravity. Uniform acceleration means the

TOPIC 1 MECHANICS
CHAPTER




          1B
     Chapter 1A finished with a discussion of the motion of a projectile cannonball's flight. An alternative way of
     considering changes in movements of objects affected by gravity is to follow what happens to their energy. An
     object held up has an amount of gravitational potential energy as a result of its position. This energy can be
     transferred to kinetic, or movement, energy if the object falls. Humans have evolved over millions of years to
     avoid situations in which they might fall a great height, as such falls are generally dangerous. The kinetic energy
     that humans have gained from falling could be transferred to other stores of energy in their bodies, through large
     forces, and cause injuries.

     The effect of gravity on the movement of an object should be considered in relation to the energy a body may
     possess or transfer. There are equations for calculating kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy, and the
     transfer of energy whena force is used to cause the transfer. These formulae and Newton's laws can be used
     together to work out everything we might want to know about the movement of any everyday object in any
     everyday situation.

     Whilst it is difficult for scientists to describe or identify the exact nature of energy, the equations that describe
     energy relationships have always worked correctly.

                                       Gravitational potential energy (£,,,,) is the energy an object has by virtue of its position in a
                                       gravitational field. Kinetic energy (£;) is the energy an object has by virtue of its movement. As
                                       objects rise or fall, gravitational potential energy can be transferred to kinetic energy and kinetic
                                       energy can be transferred to gravitational potential energy.

                                       Gravitational potential energy (gpe) can be calculated using the equation:

                                                gpe (J) = mass (kg) x gravitational field strength (N kg!) x height (m)

                                       Usually, the gpe is considered as a change caused by a change in height, for example, the change in
                                       gpe when you lift an object onto a shelf. This alters the equation slightly to consider transfers to or

                                       For example, a large jumbo jet plane might have a cruising speed of 900 kmh" and a flight mass of
                                       400 tonnes. What would its kinetic energy be?

TRANSFER BETWEEN E,,,, AND E,
The principle of conservation of energy tells us that we can never lose any energy or gain energy out
of nowhere. In any energy transfer, we must have the same total energy before and after the transfer.
Gravitational potential energy can be transferred to kinetic energy if an object falls to a lower height.
Alternatively, an object thrown upwards will slow down as its kinetic energy is transferred to gpe. In
either case:

      AE jay = MgAh = 5 mv? = E,

Depending on the situation, it can often be useful to divide out the mass that appears on both sides
of this equation. This allows a convenient calculation of how fast an object will be travelling after
falling a certain distance from rest:

      V= y2gAh

or how high an object could rise if projected upwards at a certain speed:

 LEARNING TIP
The fact that mass divides out to give the relationship v = ,/ 2gh confirms Galileo's idea that objects will all
fall to the ground at the same rate regardless of their mass.
 However, remember that all of the relationships shown in this section assume that no energy is lost through
friction or air resistance, and that this can be an important factor when some objects fall.

PRACTICAL SKILLS
Finding g from energy conservation
There are a number of different experimental methods for finding the gravitational field strength. One
example of these relies on the transfer of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. In this experiment,
we measure the velocity that has been reached by a falling object after it has fallen under gravity from a
certain height, and then alter the height and measure the velocity again.

If we vary the height from which the object falls, the gravitational potential energy is different at each height.
This gpe will all be transferred to kinetic energy.

       mgAh = 3 mv?
As we saw previously, this equation can be simplified to give:

       v? = 2gAh
Compare this equation with the equation for a straight-line graph: y = mx + c

If we plot a graph of Ah on the x-axis and v* on the y-axis, we will get a straight best-fit line. The gradient of
the line on this graph will be twice the gravitational field strength, 2g, from which we can find g.
We could find a value for g by taking a single measurement from this experiment and using the equation to
calculate it:

           2Ah
However, as mentioned in Section 1A.6, a single measurement in any experiment is prone to uncertainty                     A figE The freefall velocity

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 TM@ Calculate energy transferred as work done, including when the force is not along the line of motion.
 MTM@ Calculate the power of an energy transfer.
 @ Explain efficiency and be able to calculate.


We often make assumptions that allow simplification of calculations in physics. In general, these
assumptions make little difference as they are chosen to ignore effects which have a very small
impact on the actual real world answers. An example of this is with the transfer of gravitational
potential energy to kinetic energy, where the effects of air resistance are ignored.

It is important to remember that the principle of conservation of energy insists that no energy
can be lost in any scenario. Even if we were to consider the loss of kinetic energy to heating of
the air through air resistance, the total amount of energy would be constant; it would simply have
transferred to different stores.


WORK
In physics, the phrase ‘doing work’ has a specific meaning to do with energy use. The amount of
work done means the amount of energy transferred, so work is measured in joules.

In general terms, we can express any energy transfer as work done. For example, a 15 W light bulb
working for 10 seconds transfers 150J of electrical energy as heat and light — it does 150 J of work.
In any situation where we know how to calculate the energy before and after, we can calculate the
energy transferred and thus the work done.


FORCING WORK
If energy is transferred mechanically by means of a force, then the amount of work done can be
calculated simply:

      work done (J) = force (N) x distance moved in the direction of the force (m)

Beware of confusing AW for                An object that gains gravitational potential energy is having work done on it against its weight force.
work with W for weight, and W                   weight = mass x gravitational field strength
as the abbreviation for watts.
                                                      W=mg

                                                    work = force x distance = weight x height = mgAh



                                         WORK DONE BY FORCES AT AN ANGLE
    frietion                             In the bricklaying example on the previous page, the direction of movement was exactly in line with
                                         the force lifting the brick. This is an unusual situation, and usually the force doing work will be at an
                                         angle to the direction of movement. In fig C, gravity pulls the child down the slide but it must work
                                         against friction. The weight acts vertically downwards, but the friction acts up the slide. Friction
                                         always acts in the exact opposite direction to movement.

                                         Assuming that the child slides at constant velocity, Newton’s first law of motion tells us that this
                                         means the friction is exactly balanced by the component of gravity pulling the child down the slope.
                                         So to find the component of the weight force that is acting down the slope, we will need to resolve it

                                         in the directions of down the slope and perpendicular to it.

                                         The weight component working down the slope equals the friction, F

                                               F = mgcosé

                                         The work done is force multiplied by the distance travelled along the line of the force, so here:

                                               work = As x mgcos@

                                         This example shows us the general formula for calculating the work done when there is
                                         an angle between the force and the distance along which we are measuring:

                                         Remember:

THE MECHANICS OF SOCCER
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world in terms of numbers of people playing. It is a fast moving, skilful sport in which the ball
may fly at over 200 kilometres per hour.

In this activity, we will consider how mechanics can apply to events in soccer.

TOPIC 1 MECHANICS
CHAPTER

     Collisions can be devastating. Vehicle safety is a very important area of technological research, and much of the
     science is based on the concept of momentum and momentum transfer. Momentum is a property of a moving
     object. It is larger if the mass is greater and if the object moves faster. To change the momentum of an object
     requires a force, and this is how car crashes are so damaging. Larger forces cause more damage, whether to the
     vehicle or its passengers.

     To reduce the forces involved in transferring momentum we need to know how momentum transfers and how
     to calculate the forces depending on the momentum transfer needed.

     Not all momentum changes are dangerous. Rocket science is generally based on maximising the forces caused
     by a transfer of momentum, by maximising that momentum transfer. This will create maximum acceleration in
     order to move the rocket fast enough to gain enough gravitational potential energy to leave the Earth. This
     chapter will show you how the properties of a moving object can tell us its momentum, and how to calculate the
     transfer of momentum, and the forces involved in changing the movement of an object.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Calculate the momentum of an object.
@ Explain how momentum is gained or lost.


                                   MOMENTUM
                                   Momentum is a measure of an object’s motion. It is quite difficult to define momentum in words,
                                   but it gives an idea of what will be required to stop the object moving. The best definition is
                                   mathematical:

                                         momentum (kg ms~') = mass (kg) x velocity (ms)
                                                               p=mxv


                                   As momentum is the product of mass (a scalar) and velocity (a vector), momentum is a vector. This
                                   means its direction is very important and must be remembered. The direction will be the same as
                                   that of its velocity.

                                    A baseball has a mass of 145 grams. A fast pitcher can throw it at 40 m s~'. If this baseball is released at
                                    40ms-', its momentum is:
                                           p=mxv

                                           p = 0.145 x 40

                                           p=5.8kgms"!
                                    These example show that it is much more difficult to stop a well-thrown athletics hammer than to stop a
                                    baseball. Think about what ‘more difficult’ means in this case.

NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION                                                PRACTICAL SKILLS
If we want to bring an object to rest or to accelerate it up to a            Tae                        ;      h
certain velocity, the requirements will be different for different           hacia              oases acc
situations. A golf ball is accelerated in a very different way to a                 motion sensor
ferry. Think of the forces needed and the time for which they act.
This brings us to another way of thinking about momentum. It is
a measure of the accelerating force, and the time it is applied for,
that is required to bring an object up to the speed it is moving at.

M@ Explain the principle of conservation of linear momentum.
M@ Make calculations based on the conservation of linear momentum.




                                        When objects collide, we can use the laws of physics to calculate where the objects will go after the
                                        collision. We can use the principle of conservation of linear momentum to predict the motion
                                        of objects after a collision. This principle tells us that if we calculate the momentum of each object
                                        before they collide, the sum total of these momenta (accounting for their direction) will be the same
                                        as the sum total afterwards.



                                         The word ‘linear’ appears here to remind us that this is all about objects moving in straight lines. There are
                                         similar physics principles about rotating objects, but they use different equations for the calculations. In this
                                         book we will only consider linear momentum.


                                        This principle depends on the condition that no external force acts on the objects in question. An
                                        external force would provide an additional acceleration, and the motion of the objects would not be

 LEARNING TIP
 In a collision in which two objects join together to become one and move off together, they are often
said to ‘coalesce’.



EXPLOSIONS




A   figC      In this illustration, these trapeze artists are stationary. If they let go of each other, they will ‘explode’ - they will
    fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.

If a stationary object explodes, then the total momentum of all the shrapnel parts added up (taking
account of the direction of their movements) must be zero. The object had zero momentum at the
start, so the law of conservation of linear momentum tells us this must be the same total after the
explosion. In physics, any such event is termed an explosion, although it may not be very dramatic.
For example, if the two trapeze artists in fig C simply let go their hands and swing apart, they have
zero total momentum before and will have equal and opposite momenta afterwards, which when
added together will total zero again.

                                 A figE        Verifying the principle of conservation of linear momentum.
                                 You can investigate the transfer of momentum in collisions in the school laboratory using trolleys, or sliders
                                 on an airtrack. By recording the movement of one trolley crashing into another, you can find the
                                 momentum of each one before and after the collision. The calculation of adding up the total momenta
                                 before and after collision will allow you to prove the principle of conservation of linear momentum. Try
                                 different types of collision and trolleys with different masses. You could also try an explosion in which the
                                 trolleys come apart from a stationary position.
                                 In experiments using trolleys, we often find that momentum is actually not conserved in the measurements
                                 we make. With airtrack collisions, the measurements match very closely or exactly with the conservation of
                                 momentum theory. What might be the reasons for this difference between the two types of experiment?

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in, or connected to, these website extracts. Some of these
questions link to topics in much earlier sections of this book, so you may need to combine
concepts from different areas of physics to work out the answers.
2 For the testing of the polymer D30, calculate the range of momenta for the test balls fired
   from the cannon. (A standard hockey ball has a mass of 160 grams.)
3 Explain, with reference to Newton’s laws:
   (a) why the ‘transferred force’, i.e. the force felt through the foam by a goalkeeper wearing it,
       would be the same as the force needed to decelerate the ball
   (b) why the lines on the graph showa linear relationship with a positive gradient.
4 In light of the principle of conservation of linear momentum, how can a goalkeeper remain
   stationary, whilst the ball’s momentum is completely removed in collision with the leg pads?

     In Topic 1A, we calculated the motion of objects. We followed Newton's laws, and assumed zero air resistance.
     How safe was that assumption? Urban myths describe coins dropped from high buildings that cut deep into the
     concrete below - are these myths actually true? A very approximate calculation, using estimates of average coin
     size and mass, and the strength of the concrete, suggests that from a height of 100 metres, a falling coin could
     penetrate tens of centimetres ... if it fell in a vacuum.

     The falling coin might tumble in flight, depending upon the exact effects of air resistance. This resistance will
     slow the coin significantly, and it will hit the ground at a much lower speed than the theoretical estimate in the
     calculation mentioned above. Most likely, it will land with an impact similar to that of a hailstone.

     In this chapter, you will see how gases and liquids behave when flowing, or when causing friction with moving
     solid objects. You will also learn about some of the factors that can affect these movements.

When an object is submerged in a fluid, it feels an upwards force
caused by the fluid pressure — the upthrust. It turns out that the
size of this force is equal to the weight of the fluid that has been
displaced by the object. This is known as Archimedes’ principle.
If the object is completely submerged, the mass of fluid displaced
is equal to the volume of the object multiplied by the density of
the fluid:
        m=Vp


The weight of fluid displaced (i.e. upthrust) is then found using                    A figC (a) If the upthrust on an object is less than its weight, then the

                                        THE HYDROMETER
                                        The idea of floating at different depths is the principle behind the hydrometer, an instrument used
                                        to determine the density of a fluid. The device has a constant weight, so it will sink lower in fluids of
                                        lesser density. This is because a greater volume of a less-dense fluid must be displaced to balance
                                        the weight of the hydrometer. Scale markings on the narrow stem of the hydrometer indicate the
                                        density of liquid.

                                        Some car batteries use a sulfuric acid solution. The density of this solution tells us the charge level of
                                        the battery, and should be checked by a mechanic when the car is serviced.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 ®@ Understand the terms laminar flow and turbulent flow.


If you ski downa hill, you can go faster by tucking your body into a crouching position. By presenting
a smaller area to air resistance, you reduce the force slowing you down. However, speed skiers
chasing world record speeds go further in their efforts to increase their speeds.

LAMINAR FLOW
Whena fluid moves, there are two ways this can happen: laminar flow (also called streamline
flow) and turbulent flow. In general, laminar flow occurs at lower speeds, and will change
to turbulent flow as the fluid velocity increases past a certain value. The velocity at which this
changeover occurs will vary depending upon the fluid in question and the shape of the area through
which it is flowing.

If we take a simple example such as water flowing slowly through a pipe, it will be laminar flow.
Think of the water in the pipe as several concentric cylinders from the central axis outwards to the
layer of water in contact with the pipe itself. Friction between the outermost layer and the pipe wall
means this layer will only be able to move slowly. The next layer in will experience friction with the
slow-moving outermost layer, but this will be less than the friction between the outermost layer and
the pipe. Thus, this inner layer will move faster than the outermost layer. The next layer in moves
faster again, with the velocity of each layer increasing nearer the centre, where a central cylinder of
water is moving the fastest.

As with most areas of scientific investigation, Isaac          Newton produced much work on the subject of
fluid flow. In particular, he is credited with the development of equations to describe the frictional
force between the layers in streamline flow. If a liquid follows his formulae, as most common liquids
do, it is known as a Newtonian fluid.

In the wind tunnel in fig C, the smoke would flow over the car in
exactly the same pattern forever if all the wind tunnel factors were
kept constant. Changing the speed of the airflow in the tunnel
allows designers to test how the prototype would behave at faster
speeds, and at what point laminar flow changes to turbulent flow.

When you walk in a swimming pool, you find it much harder than
walking through air. The friction acting against you is greater
in water than it is in air. This frictional force in fluids is due to
viscosity. If the frictional force caused by movement through the
fluid is small, we say the viscosity is low.                                                                      a Vobsads water Flo rate                o)

                        You can investigate how the viscosity of a liquid changes with temperature using a re-sealable tin or bottle
                        half-full of a test fluid (such as syrup). The temperature of the liquid is varied using a water bath. The
                        viscosity of the liquid will affect the rate at which the tin or bottle rolls down a fixed ramp.

You have previously learned that acceleration due to gravity near
the surface of the Earth is about 9.81 ms~*. An object falling
in a vacuum does accelerate at this rate. However, it is unusual
for objects to be dropped near the surface of the Earth in a
vacuum (in nearly all such cases a physics teacher is likely to
be demonstrating to a class). In reality, in order to calculate an
object’s actual acceleration when falling, we need to take account
of all the forces acting on it, combine these to find a resultant

force, and then use Newton's second law (a ==) to calculate the
resulting acceleration.

VISCOUS DRAG
You would find it difficult to wade through a swimming pool filled with oil because of the oil’s viscous
drag. This is the friction force between a solid and a fluid. Calculating this fluid friction force can be
relatively simple. On the other hand, it can be very complicated for large objects, fast objects and
irregularly shaped objects, as the turbulent flow creates an unpredictable situation.

It must be remembered that the simple slow-falling sphere of Stokes’ law is not a common situation
and in most real applications the terminal velocity value is a result of more complex calculations.
However, the principle that larger objects generally fall faster holds true for most objects without
a parachute.

Load lines are painted on the side of ships to show how low they may safely sit in the water. Although usually associated with the British
Member of Parliament Samuel Plimsoll (1824-1898), such lines have been in use for hundreds of years.

In this activity, we will look at how the ‘Plimsoll line’ came to be required by British law.




WHAT IS A PLIMSOLL LINE?
A commercial ship is properly loaded when the ship’s                       ————
waterline is at the ship’s Plimsoll line.

The Plimsoll line is a reference mark located on a ship’s hull
that indicates the maximum depth to which the vessel may be
safely immersed when loaded with cargo. This depth varies with
a ship’s dimensions, type of cargo, time of year, and the water
densities encountered in port and at sea. Once these factors have
been accounted for, a ship’s captain can determine the appropriate
Plimsoll line needed for the voyage (see fig B).

Samuel Plimsoll (1824-1898) was a member of the British
Parliament and he was concerned with the loss of ships and crews
due to overloading. In 1876, he persuaded Parliament to pass the
Unseaworthy Ships Bill, which required marking a ship’s sides
with a line that would disappear below the waterline if the ship
was overloaded. The line, also known as the Plimsoll mark, is
found in the middle of the ship on both the port and starboard sides
of cargo ships and is still used worldwide by the shipping industry.

CHAPTER




     You probably rarely consider the likelihood that a bridge will fail as you walk or drive over it. However, when
     designing the bridge, and selecting the materials to use in it, an engineer has to ensure that this likelihood is
     minimal.

     Design processes for any new project need to include specifications indicating the extremes of conditions that
     may apply. A bridge needs to withstand an overloaded lorry that is not complying with weight restrictions; a
     snowboarding helmet might be used by a person on a snowmobile; or a motorist might try to use a climbing
     rope to tow their car. Some of these uses might be classed as unreasonable, and the designer would not expect
     to have to make their product strong enough to stand up to such extreme forces.

     If you were designing a new harbour wall, what extreme weather conditions would you ensure that the wall
     could withstand? Would it be good enough to make sure it could withstand a storm with such strong winds and
     waves that only occurs once every 50 years? 100 years? 1000 years? And how do you achieve the strength
     required within budget?

     In this chapter we will see how the strength of materials can be measured, and thus how to choose the right
     material for any given job.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 lM Understand Hooke's law and be able to make
     calculations using it.
 M@ Calculate the elastic strain energy stored ina
     deformed material sample.                                                           a
 lM Estimate the elastic strain energy stored from a
     force—extension graph for a sample.


Whenever a force acts on a material sample, the sample will be
deformed to a different size or shape. If it is made longer, the
force is referred to as tension, and the extra length is known as
the extension. For a material being squashed to a smaller size,
both the force and the decrease in size are called compression,
although the decrease in size could be referred to as a negative
extension.

ELASTIC STRAIN ENERGY
The work done in deforming a material sample before it reaches its
elastic limit will be stored within the material as elastic strain energy,
E.,. We have previously seen that work done can be calculated by
multiplying the force by the distance moved in the direction of the
force. This is true in deforming materials too, but Hooke’s law means
that the force value varies for different extensions. If we plot the
extension of a spring with increasingly large masses hanging on it,
                                                                                               0          0.04        0.08        0.12

                        If a non-linear force—extension or force—compression graph has a curved line, finding the area may
                        involve estimating or counting the squares on the graph paper under the line. In this case, you will
                        also need to multiply the number of squares by the elastic strain energy value (F x Ax) for each

                         Be careful to distinguish between ‘length’ and ‘extension’. You may be given a measurement for either
                         length or extension. You should check carefully to see if you need to calculate the extension from
                         information you have about lengths.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 M@ Interpret stress—strain graphs.
 MTM Understand and apply the terms limit of proportionality, elastic limit, yield point, breaking stress, elastic deformation
     and plastic deformation in relation to stress—strain graphs.



STRESS-STRAIN ANALYSIS
From the definition of the Young modulus, the stress should be proportional to the strain if a material
is undergoing elastic deformation. Therefore we should get a straight-line graph if we plot stress
against strain. When this is done, we do find a straight-line relationship for small stresses. Once the
limit of proportionality is passed, the internal structure of the material starts to behave differently.
This means that the graph starts to curve. Depending on the material under test, the graph will
go through various phases as the molecular structure of each material determines its response
to increasing stress. Eventually, the stress will become too great, and the material will fracture. At
this point, the line on the graph must end, as no further data can be obtained about the material. It
cannot withstand higher stresses, so the graph cannot be plotted any further.


                                                                     D

A   figA The stress-strain graph for a metal gives detailed information about how the material behaves under different
    levels of stress. The gradient of the straight-line portion of the graph will be equal to the value of the Young modulus.


 LEARNING TIP
 It can be confusing to see the sections of a stress-strain graph where the line goes down. In reality, these
 graphs are generated from results of materials testing in which the strain is continuously increased on a
 machine that can measure the stress within a material. This stress can go down if there is a change in the
 arrangement of the molecular structure of the material.


Fig A is a generalised stress-strain graph for a metal, such as copper. Most metals will follow the
shape shown here, and there are various areas of interest on the graph.

In the straight-line portion from the origin to point A, the metal extends elastically, and will return to
its original size and shape when the force is removed. The gradient of the straight-line portion of the
graph is equal to the Young modulus for the metal.
82   2B.3 STRESS-STRAIN GRAPHS                                                               SOLID MATERIAL PROPERTIES

                        Point A is the limit of proportionality. Slightly beyond this point, the metal may still behave
                        elastically, but it cannot be relied upon to increase strain in proportion to the stress.

                        Point B is the elastic limit. Beyond this point, the material is permanently deformed and will not
                        return to its original size and shape, even when the stress is completely released.

                        Point C is the yield point, beyond which the material undergoes a sudden increase in extension as
                        its atomic substructure is significantly re-organised. The metal ‘gives’ just beyond its yield point as
                        the metal’s atoms slip past each other to new positions where the stress is reduced.

                         LEARNING TIP
                         It is quite common for the limit of proportionality, the elastic limit and the yield point to be in the same
                         place on the graph. They have been separated here to explain the different ideas behind each.


                        Point D represents the highest possible stress within this material. It is called the Ultimate Tensile
                        Stress, or UTS, ay.

                        Point E is the fracture stress, or breaking stress. It is the value that the stress will be in the material
                        when the sample breaks.


                         WORKED EXAMPLE
                         The European Space Agency (ESA) have tested a material known as ‘IMPRESS intermetallic alloy’. Fig B
                         illustrates a stress-strain graph for this material at two different temperatures, to see how it would stand up
                         under different conditions.

                         Considering first the Young modulus, you can see that the ESA have drawn measurements on the graph to
                         make the calculation of the gradient of the straight-line portions of the graphs for each temperature plot.
                         For example, at 15 °C:

                                                E= 1.33 x 10''Pa

                         The values labelled as op2 are the stress values at each temperature, which will result in a permanent
                         deformation strain of 0.2%. These are in the plastic region, and the permanent deformations are indicated
                         by the dashed lines connected back to 0.2% on the x-axis.

safe landing pad
A figC An experiment to find the stress-strain relationships when stretching a metal wire. With detailed analysis of
    the stress-strain graph of the metal, you can find the Young modulus.

You can perform a simple experiment to measure the stiffness constant - the Young modulus - for a metal
by stretching a thin wire. The original length and diameter of the wire must be measured first. Then, using
increasing forces as the independent variable, you will need to take measurements of the extension
corresponding to each force. There will be some readings during the wire's elastic deformation region which
will increase uniformly. Beyond the elastic limit, it will increase with greater extensions for each increase in the
load force until, eventually, the fracture stress will be reached and the wire will snap. Safety goggles must be
worn during this experiment, as wires that snap under tension are a hazard to the eyes.
The graph in fig B has been plotted with the strain on the x-axis, so that when the gradient of the line is
calculated this will give you the value for the stiffness constant, or Young modulus:




Normal practice is to plot experimental results with the independent variable on the x-axis. Although your
experiment will have the stress as the independent variable, it is usual to draw the curve of these results
with stress on the y-axis. Plot this graph and find the Young modulus of the metal you used, by finding the
gradient of the straight-line portion of the graph.



  Safety Note: Use eye protection to prevent injury if the wire snaps. Use a ‘drop box’ on the landing pad
  to keep hands and feet out of the ‘drop zone’.

2./} Searle's apparatus, as shown in fig D is is used in experiments to find the Young modulus for a metal
     wire. With this apparatus, the test wire hangs vertically, parallel to an identical control wire. Weights
     are added to load the test wire only, and its extension, measured as an excess over the length of the
      control wire rather than from its original length, is calculated. Explain how this setup will allow the
      experimenter to avoid possible error caused by variations in the room temperature.                               A   figD   Searle's apparatus.

If a manufacturer of climbing ropes is to choose a material for a new rope, what properties would they want the material to have? Apart
from low cost, they will need to consider whether it will safely hold climbers, especially when they fall and the rope has to save them.

In this activity, we will look at some important aspects of the properties of some climbing ropes.

    climbing.
    (a) Compare and contrast the style of presentation from each source.
    (b) Discuss the safety considerations that the authors (and their insurers) will have had to
        think about before publishing the information in each case.




PHYSICS IN DETAIL

Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions link to topics earlier in this
book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out the
answers.

2 (a) Calculate the weight of a 50m length of DMM's Couloir rope.
    (b) Calculate the density of DMM's Orbit rope.
3 (a) Explain the physics behind the caption in fig 7-19 from the Mountaineering book.

    ( b) The table of angles from the Mountaineering book refers to the total angle between the
        slings (short support ropes) in the symmetrical situation shown in fig 7-19a. Explain why
        the force on each anchor would increase as suggested, and calculate how accurately the
        force percentages have been reported.
4 (a) Looking at the fall tests, explain why lower impact force ropes will stretch more.
    (b) Considering part (a), explain why a larger percentage dynamic elongation, compared
        with the static elongation, minimises injuries from the rope stopping a fall.

    energy absorbed by a rope before failure. This is given by the equation:

TOPIC 3 WAVES AND THE PARTICLE
        NATURE OF LIGHT
CHAPTER




     As waves are a means to transfer energy, they are very important in the world around us. From the destruction
     caused by earthquakes, to the determination of the chemical composition of distant stars, to whether or not it's
     worth taking your surfboard to the beach at the weekend, we study waves in virtually every part of human
     experience.

     Topic 3 covers many aspects of the science behind waves, and in this chapter we will begin this study with some
     basic definitions and the wave equation. As waves and wave mathematics are relevant to many areas of future
     study, it is important to understand these basic definitions.

      Even when scientists consider new areas of study, they often find that wave motions are the basis of what they
     are trying to understand. The fundamental causes of gravity have never been well understood. For example,
     experimental observations of gravitational waves in order to expand that understanding are currently being
     done by a number of universities around the world.




          Units of measurement (e.g. the hertz, Hz)

          Use of standard form and ordinary form (e.g. using the speed of light)

          Changing the subject of an equation (e.g. using the wave equation)

          Solving algebraic equations (e.g. comparing the two equations for wave speed)

          Substituting numerical values into algebraic equations (e.g. a radar calculation to find the distance to an aeroplane)

                             ENERGY TRANSFER
                            A wave is a means for transferring energy via oscillations. Whilst energy moves from one place to
                            another, the waves cause no net movement of any matter.

                            A mechanical wave is one in which there needs to be some sort of material medium — a substance that
                            oscillates to allow the transfer of the energy. For example, a sound wave of a human voice transfers
                            energy from one person’s vocal cords to another's eardrum by the repeated vibrations of air molecules.

                            Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through repeated oscillations of electric and magnetic
                            fields, but these fields do not need matter to support them. Indeed, the interaction between
                            electromagnetic waves and matter generally slows their transfer of energy. For example, light travels
                            more slowly in water than it does in a vacuum.

WAVE MEASUREMENTS
There are a number of important properties of waves that
scientists measure for various purposes. In most cases, you can
determine these from the graphs shown in fig A and fig B.
Displacement: the position of a particular point on a wave, at a
particular instant in time, measured from the mean (equilibrium)
position. (Symbol: various, often x; SI units: m.)
Amplitude: the magnitude of the maximum displacement
reached by an oscillation in the wave. (Symbol: A; SI units: m.)
Frequency: the number of complete wave cycles per second.
This may sometimes be measured as the number of complete
waves passing a point per second. (Symbol: f; SI units: hertz, Hz.)
Wavelength: the distance between a point on a wave and the
same point on the next cycle of the wave, for example, the
distance between adjacent wave peaks. (Symbol: A; SI units: m.)
Period: the time taken for one complete oscillation at one point
on the wave. This will also be the time taken for the wave to travel           A    figC    Investigating the speed of sound in air.

Phase: the stage a given point on a wave is through a complete
cycle. Phase is measured in angle units, as a complete wave cycle                 Safety Note: If high volumes and certain frequencies are used,

Wave speed: the rate of movement of the wave — the same as
speed in general. (Symbol: v, or c for speed of electromagnetic
waves; SI units: ms7!.)

time, as with the speed of anything. However, as each wave has                The natural habitat for some bats is woodland, and they fly through

 It can be difficult to make accurate measurements from the screen of
 an oscilloscope, so we need to synchronise the traces to minimise the
 effect of random error in taking such a measurement. Firstly, with
 both microphones at the same distance from the loudspeaker, the
 two traces appear in identical phase positions (in phase). If we slide
 the second microphone slowly away from the loudspeaker, we will
 move the traces out of phase with each other until eventually they
 come back to exact synchronisation. At this point, the distance
 between the two microphones is exactly one wavelength, A. We set
 the frequency on the signal generator, and so the wave equation can

                               Earthquake waves, also called seismic waves, come in different types. Fig F shows Primary, or ‘P’,
                               waves and Secondary, or ‘S’, waves. These are the standard longitudinal and transverse seismic
                               waves, with P-waves travelling faster, and arriving first, leading to their name.

Earthquakes are among the most deadly natural hazards. There are around 100 earthquakes each year of a size that could cause
serious damage.

In this activity, we will look at some of the detail about the detection of earthquake waves.

EARTHQUAKE FAQs
  What is an earthquake and what causes them to happen?                      What are seismograms? How do you read them?

  When an earthquake occurs, it releases energy in the form
  of seismic waves that radiate from the earthquake source in
  all directions. The different types of energy waves shake the
  ground in different ways and also travel through the earth at
  different velocities. The fastest wave, and therefore the first to
  arrive at a given location, is called the P-wave. The P-wave,              A figD There are many different types of seismometers, but they all

          3B
     Some of the most interesting and beautiful phenomena are the product of two or more waves combining their
     effects. It is surprising that waves can pass through each other, creating some spectacular effects, and then
     continue on their way as if they had never met.

     We will look at the ways in which different waves combine, along with the reasons why they might not combine,
     and learn how to predict and measure the outcomes of these combinations. The production of stationary wave
     patterns can be unexpected, but it is the basis for the functioning of musical instruments. The variety and beauty
     of musical instruments, along with the variation in the sounds they produce, is a result of their need to generate
     a stationary wave by combining multiple wave movements together.

      Diffraction and interference can be explained with some simple mathematical ideas. When these relationships
     are repeated over and over again, in different places, it can lead to striking sights, such as the rainbow reflected
     from an oily puddle. Also it leads to the limits of scientific knowledge, such as the discovery of gravitational
     waves.

                                  PHASE
                                  All points in a wave will be at some position through their cycle of oscillation. Some of these
                                  positions in the cycle have their own names, such as peak (or crest), trough, compression or
                                  rarefaction. The remaining points through a cycle are important, but there are too many to give
                                  them all names. We describe any position through a cycle by a number, referred to as the phase.
                                  A complete cycle is considered to be equivalent to rotating through a complete circle, so the phase
                                  position will be an angle measurement, where a complete cycle is equivalent to 360°.

                                  A   figA     Wave phase represents the position through a complete cycle, measured in angle units.


                                  It is quite common to measure phase in the alternative angle units of radians, where one complete
                                  cycle is 27rrad. Table A shows common phase positions in the two equivalent angle units, along with
                                  the fraction of a complete wavelength that they represent. As waves are, by definition, a repetitive
                                  cyclic process, phases of more than 360° could be reduced to their equivalent value within a first
                                  cycle. For example, the wave peak after 1.25 cycles has exactly the same phase as the wave peak in

                                  the first cycle, so its phase could be quoted as either 450° or 90° (22 or rad),      WT

If a question asks for a phase
value, just give one answer. If

you try to express the same
answer in radians and in

Diagrams of waves are often drawn as lines, as in fig B, where
all the points on a line represent points on the wave that are at
exactly the same phase position, perhaps a wave crest. These lines
are called wavefronts. They are how the sea might look observed
from a helicopter, where the troughs are all in shadow and so
appear darker.

When waves meet, each wave will be trying to cause a wave                                                          upwards briefly as it moves. When both meet at the same location,

displacement will be the vector sum of the displacements caused                                                    up, so the water raises even higher — to the level of the two pulse
by the individual waves. This is called wave superposition.                                                        displacements added together. This effect is thought to explain

                                SUPERPOSITION OF CONTINUOUS WAVES
                                If, rather than a single point along the path of the waves, we consider waves superposing over a large
                                space, the outcome is a continuous wave that is the sum of the displacements over time in each
                                location. If the two waves are in phase, their effect will be to produce a larger-amplitude resultant
                                wave. This is known as constructive interference. If identical waves meet and are exactly out of
S33:
                  WW
                                phase — if their phase difference is 180° or 7 radians — then the resultant is a zero-amplitude wave.
                                This idea of complete destructive interference can be confusing: imagine shining two beams of
                                light to the same place, and at that point you see blackness. In the right circumstances, as explained
                                in Section 3B.4, this is exactly what happens.

                                It is important to know the phase difference between two waves, in order to determine what will
                                happen as a result of their superposition. Waves that constructively interfere, as with the top pair in
A   figF   Constructive and     fig F, must be in phase, which means they have a phase difference of zero. As phase repeats every
    destructive interference.   complete cycle, this could also be said to be a phase difference of 360° or 277 radians.

STANDING WAVES
Continuous waves travelling in opposite directions will superpose
continuously, and this can set up a stationary wave pattern, also
known as a standing wave. The waves need to be of the same                                     A
speed and frequency, with similar amplitudes, and have a constant
phase relationship. Waves with the same frequency and a constant                displacement
phase relationship are said to be coherent.                                                                                                                           a

Stationary waves have this name because the profile of the wave
does not move along, it only oscillates. This also means that wave
energy does not pass along a standing wave, so they do not meet
our strict definition of waves, which do transfer energy and are                               A
more precisely called progressive waves. A situation such as

played, the first wave will meet its own reflection. These two
coherent waves set up a standing wave on the string. There are
points where the resultant displacement is always zero. These
points never move, and are called nodes. The points of maximum
amplitude are called antinodes. Note that all points between one                 ~
node and the next are in the same phase at all times, although                                                                                       peer             5

SINGLE SLIT DIFFRACTION
If we change the width of the diffraction slit, or the wavelength of the light, we will alter the
diffraction pattern that we observe. A narrower slit widens the central maximum, as well as the
further maxima and minima.

THE DIFFRACTION GRATING
A diffraction grating is a device that will cause multiple diffraction patterns, which then overlap. This
creates an interference pattern with a mathematically well-defined spacing between bright and dark
spots. It is a collection of a very large number of slits through which the waves can pass. These slits
are parallel and have a fixed distance between each slit.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 lM Understand what is meant by the terms coherence, path difference and interference.
 @ Interpret the relationship between phase difference and path difference.
 M Explain examples of wave interference.



TWO-SOURCE INTERFERENCE
In Section 3B.2 we saw that a wave meeting its own reflection would set up a standing wave pattern,
also known as an interference pattern. Reflection is a convenient way to generate coherent waves
that will produce a standing wave. However, any combination of waves that have the same frequency
and a constant phase relationship will produce this result. For example, in fig A, the loudspeakers
are connected to the same signal generator, so they simultaneously produce identical sound waves.
Wherever the sound waves meet, they will superpose to produce a resultant displacement of air
molecules. This means there will be points of maximum amplitude — antinodes — such as at position
X, or points of zero amplitude — nodes — where there will be silence, such as position Y. The relative
positions of nodes and antinodes will depend on the distance from the speakers, their separation and
the wavelength of the waves.

TWO-SLIT INTERFERENCE
Another interference pattern can be observed if light is shone into an experimental set-up that causes
it to create two coherent wave sources that produce a standing wave pattern. This effect was first
demonstrated by Thomas Young in 1803, using sunlight as the light source. A simple
laboratory set-up using a torch, similar to that shown in fig B, would show a pattern of dark and light
fringes that resembles the nodes and antinodes in a standing light wave.

Young explained his experiment using a theory that light behaves as a wave. In classical physics,
interference is a phenomenon that can only occur with waves. Young’s theory was highly

                                    Each point in a two-source interference pattern will have a superposition result that depends on the
                                    phase difference between the waves coming from each source to that point. That phase difference
                                    will, in turn, depend on the relative distances to the point from each of the slits compared with the
                                    wavelength. In fig E, imagine the distance from the slit to X along the blue line is 100 wavelengths,
                                    and the distance along the red line is 115 wavelengths. As the path difference is exactly 15
                                    wavelengths, the waves will be in phase at point X, and will constructively interfere, to produce a
                                    maximum resultant, as in an antinode. If we passed laser light through the two slits, then point X
                                    would showa bright spot on a screen placed there.

Alternatively, imagine the blue line distance to X is 97 wavelengths but the red line distance is 98.5
wavelengths. The path difference is 1.5 wavelengths. In this case, the waves will always be 37 radians
out of phase — always in antiphase — and so will always cancel. This would look like a standing wave
node, and if it were the laser light two-slit experiment, there would be a dark spot at point X.

Note that these wavelength numbers are examples only. As light waves are so short, the numbers
should be millions of wavelengths for standard laboratory distances for X.

      produce constructive interference. Any points where the path difference is given by      5    will cause destructive

      interference.

The connection between the phase difference and the path difference comes if we remember
that each complete cycle (or wavelength) corresponds to 27 radians in phase. Waves from one
slit meeting waves from the other slit at a point will each have had to travel to that point, cycling
through wavelengths as they go. By comparing the path difference, this can be converted into phase
differences.

Points where the path difference is equal to nA exactly, will have a phase difference of 2n7 exactly
and will be in phase, producing constructive interference.

Points where the path difference is equal to           exactly, will have a phase difference of

The marimba is a percussion instrument like a xylophone. A standing wave is set up in the wood when it is struck with a hammer.
The wooden bars vibrate with frequencies related to their sizes.

In this activity, we will look at some of the detail about tuning the marimba bars.

PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in detail. Some of these questions link to topics earlier in this
book, so you may need to combine concepts from different areas of physics to work out the
answers.

          3C
      Humans have long wondered at the appearance of rainbows and other ways light can trick our eyes. Developing
     our understanding of the physics behind such natural phenomena has allowed us to develop more and more
     complex imaging techniques. Deep drilling for oil exploration often uses optical fibres to gain an image of the
     rock at hundreds of metres depth. The same imaging physics allows doctors to view inside their patients with an
     endoscope.

     This chapter will explain the details of refraction in different materials and how this leads to the properties of
     different types of lenses, as well as total internal reflection in optical fibres. Broadband internet communications
     are made possible by applying this idea.




          Substituting numerical values into algebraic equations (e.g. finding the refractive index)

          Changing the subject of an equation (e.g. finding the critical angle)

          Plotting two variables from experimental data (e.g. plotting a graph of experimental results of refraction
          in glass)

          Determining the slope of a linear graph (e.g. using a graph of experimental results to find the refractive index of   aa
          glass)

REFRACTION
When waves pass from one medium into another, there is
a change in speed. The frequency remains constant, so the
change in speed causes a change in wavelength. If the waves are

A    fig A    Wave speed depends on the medium, and refraction is caused by a
     change in medium changing the wave speed.                                   LEARNING TIP
Any ray crossing an interface along the normal line does not change              In any optical system, light rays will follow exactly the same path if
direction at all, as the wavefronts are parallel to the edge. Therefore          they are transmitted back from the end in the reverse direction. This

their wavelength is equally changed along the length of the wavefront.           means the angles involved in refraction are the same whether the
                                                                                 light moves from the less dense medium into the more dense one
If the wavefront is at an angle to the interface, then the part that

because different parts of it are travelling at different speeds.

The changes in direction caused by refraction are the basis for the
functioning of lenses, and can lead to optical illusions.

Often, many waves travel together, with oscillations in a variety of
planes. In this case, light from this source is said to be unpolarised.
This is how light emerges from a light bulb, a candle and the sun.



 LEARNING TIP
 Polarisation is only possible with transverse waves. If a wave is
 polarised, it must be a transverse wave.

Refractive indices can be determined to several decimal places, and tiny variations can highlight very small differences in the
compositions of materials like glass.

In this activity, we will look at some ideas about identifying glass in crime scene investigations.

  Optical Properties
  Refractive index is a function of chemical composition and
  atomic arrangement (Stoiber and Morse 1981). Refractive
  index is the most commonly measured property in the forensic
  examination of glass fragments (Koons et al. 2002), because:

        NATURE OF LIGHT
CHAPTER




          3D
     Albert Einstein is one of the world’s most famous physicists. So what did a mainly self-educated office worker in
     the Swiss patent office produce that could make him so important? In 1905, Einstein had what is often referred
     to as his Annus Mirabilis - year of miracles - in which he published scientific papers on four separate topics. All
     four papers made significant breakthroughs in the topics they were concerned with, and were diverse, not
     directly related to each other. His paper on the photoelectric effect won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics.

      In this chapter, we will be dealing with the ideas that electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and particles, such
     as electrons, can behave as both waves and particles. Usually we only observe one aspect or the other, such as
     the photoelectric effect demonstrating that light can be a particle. Scientists are still not clear on an explanation
     for both light and electrons that can universally describe their behaviour under all circumstances. Einstein
     helped us along the way, but he did not solve the puzzle. Maybe someday you will.

that any and every point on the wavefront is a new source of
circular waves travelling forwards from that point. When the
movement of these numerous circular waves is plotted, and then
their superposition considered, the resultant wave will be the new
position of the original wavefront.

PHOTON ENERGY
For electromagnetic radiation, the energy of the photon can be calculated by multiplying the
frequency by Planck’s constant, h. This constant has an extremely small value because it represents
the fundamental minimum possible step in energy. In SI units, 4 = 6.63 x 107** Js. If we work on
very small scales, photons cannot have energy values that differ by less than the Planck constant.
This means that there are some energy values that are impossible in our universe. Such a system of
minimum sized steps is called quantisation.

The energy of a photon is given by the equation:
          photon energy (J) = Planck's constant (J s) x frequency (Hz)

ELECTRONS ARE PARTICLES
Experiments that produce ions can demonstrate electrons behaving as particles because a fixed lump
of mass and charge is removed from the atom in order to change the atom into an ion. The charge to
mass ratio is a unique identifying property of particles, and was first demonstrated for the electron by
J.J. Thomson in 1897. Robert Millikan, in an experiment finally published in 1913, took this one step
further to find the electron charge itself. The fact that electrons hold a fixed amount of charge and a
fixed mass indicates they are localised particles.

                              If electrons are made to travel at very high speeds, they will pass through gaps and produce a
                              diffraction pattern. They will also interact with a double-slit apparatus to produce the interference
                              pattern seen when waves pass through two slits. Diffraction and interference are not expected
                              by classical particles, as they should simply travel straight through the slits. Observation of these
                              experimental results proves that electrons can behave as waves.


                              WAVES OR PARTICLES?
                              The experimental observations highlighted in this section have suggested that both electrons and
                              electromagnetic radiation seem to contradict our explanations of them. Physicists have good
                              theoretical descriptions of the wave and particle natures for electrons and also for electromagnetic
                              radiation. However, we do not have a complete and perfect single theory that explains both correctly
                              for either electrons or EM radiation.

If ultraviolet light is shone onto a negatively charged zinc plate,
the plate loses its charge. The explanation for this is that the light
causes electrons to leave the metal, removing the negative charge.
The electrons that are released are called photoelectrons.
However, variations on this experiment produce some surprising                                                                 Gold leaf falls immediately

LEARNING TIP                          THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT EQUATION
The SI units for the terms            Einstein developed an equation to explain the photoelectric effect, which is based on the
in the photoelectric effect           conservation of energy. We have previously seen that the energy of a photon can be found from

The electronvolt is the amount        the remaining energy will be available for the electron emission kinetic energy to be emitted from

                                      Or, stated in terms of the conservation of energy, the photon energy transferred to the electron is
                                      used partly to escape the metal surface and partly for its kinetic energy on leaving the metal. So, a

                                      We could use the photoelectric effect equation to measure Planck’s constant and the work function
                                      for a metal. In a vacuum, we place the metal as the anode in a cell that has a gap to the cathode —
                                      see fig B. When we shine light of a known frequency onto the anode, photoelectrons will be emitted
                                      and the current registered on the ammeter. If we slowly increase the pd across the photoelectric cell,
                                      eventually the anode will become sufficiently positive that all photoelectrons will be stopped and
                                      attracted back to it, so the photoelectric current will be zero. This stopping voltage, V., will give us
                                      the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, from the definition of voltage:
                                                                1

                                      If we use a range of light frequencies and find the stopping voltage for each, we can plot a graph
                                      of the photoelectron maximum kinetic energy, on the y-axis, against frequency, on the x-axis.
                                      Comparison with the equation for a straight line shows us that the graph should producea straight
                                      best-fit line and the gradient will be equal to Planck’s constant.

                                In Section 4A.6 we will see that electrons in semiconductors can have varying amounts of energy, and
                                that the energy they have can put them into the valence band or conduction band. These energy bands
                                are wide in solids — there is a large range of values of energy that the electron could have and still be
                                in that band. In free atoms, such as those in a gas, the energy values that the electrons could have are
                                limited to a small number of exact values, often called energy levels.

                                A   figA An energy level diagram for hydrogen. The energy values are negative, as we have to put energy in to lift the
                                    electron up from the ground state.


                                EXCITATION AND DE-EXCITATION
                                Fig A illustrates the energy values that electrons of hydrogen could have. Under normal
                                circumstances, an electron in an atom of hydrogen would be in its ground state. This is the lowest
                                energy level, with a quantum number (or level) of 7 = 1. In order to move up energy levels, the
                                electron must take in some energy. This is called excitation. Electrons can become excited if the
                                atom collides with another particle. Alternatively, if the electron absorbs a photon that has exactly
                                the correct amount of energy, the electron can jump to a higher energy level. For example, the
                                difference in energy between the ground state (—2.18 x 107'8 J) and the n = 2 state (—5.45 x 107'% J)
                                is 1.635 x 107'8 J.

                                A photon with exactly this energy could be absorbed by an electron in the ground state of hydrogen,
                                and this would lift the electron up to the energy level above the ground state, n = 2, and the photon
                                would no longer exist. This is illustrated in fig B.

                                         Light made up of multiple wavelengths (colours) can be split up to show which colours are present.
                                         This could be done using a diffraction grating in which the amount of diffraction is dependent on
                                         the wavelength, and so the various colours will spread different amounts. The resulting spectrum will

                                          (colour).

                                         For example, fig D shows the line spectrum from hydrogen gas. The gas has electricity passed
                                         through it, and this will excite the hydrogen atoms. Each coloured line is a wavelength of light given
                                         off as a result of an electron dropping between two energy levels. The different energy gaps cause
                                         the difference in wavelengths emitted. When viewed all together, the colours merge, and the gas
                                         glows a purple colour.



PRACTICAL SKILLS
Investigating gas discharge spectra
A high voltage will cause an electric current to pass through a gas in a discharge tube. The electrical energy excites the electrons in each atom of the
gas, and they then drop energy levels at random times, giving off a photon for each energy level transition. As there are so many atoms, it appears as
if the gas is continuously emitting light, and of all the possible colours - all the possible transitions within its energy level ladder. Using a diffraction
grating, we can analyse the light emitted from the tube to detect the separate colours, or wavelengths, being emitted. We observe a line spectrum.




A    figE   A gas discharge tube demonstrates the emission of photons by excited electrons of a gas. A diffraction grating shows the separate lines in the
      spectrum.

lf we change the tube for one containing a different gas, we will observe a different line spectrum.




    Safety Note: Gas discharge tubes operate at a hazardous voltage. Operate with shrouded connections to minimise the risk of electric shock.

SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
1   The article opposite was written for an American website blog. Consider the article and
    comment on the type of writing being used. Think about the following, for example. Is this a
    scientist reporting the results of their experiments, a scientific review of data, a newspaper or
    magazine style article for a specific audience? Then answer the following questions:
    (a) Is there any bias present in the report? What parts of the article suggest any bias?
    (b) How has the author adapted their use of language to suit their audience? Would the
        wording be different, for example, if they were trying to explain the same ideas to
        primary school children? Or to a US government committee for energy infrastructure?
    (c) Discuss the extent to which the ‘problems’ highlighted by the author undermine the basic
       idea in the article.



PHYSICS IN DETAIL
Now we will look at the physics in, or connected to, this article. Some of these questions link to
topics in much earlier sections of this book, so you may need to combine concepts from
different areas of physics to work out the answers.
2 Convert all the dimensions quoted in the article into SI units: (1 inch, 1” = 2.54 cm;
    1 foot, 1’ = 12 inches; 1 mile = 1.6 km)
3 The radiation from the sun lands on Earth with a power of approximately 1000 W m~*. How
    much sunlight power would land on one of the solar panels considered in the article?
4 Ifthe average wavelength of light from the sun landing at the surface of the Earth is 550 nm,
    how many photons will be landing on this one solar panel per second? Discuss whether it is
    reasonable to make this wavelength average for this calculation.
5 If the panel produces 250 W, what is the efficiency of one solar panel?
6 (a) If the density of air is 1 kgm~?, and the average wind speed is 6.0ms"', what area of wind
       turbines would be needed to transfer the equivalent kinetic energy from the wind as the
       power needed in the solar cells calculation in the blog article?
    (b) Awind turbine manufacturer claims that their new ‘super-turbines’ are 80% efficient,
        have 100 m diameter rotors and need 1 square kilometre of land so as not to interfere
        with each other's wind. How much land would be needed for a giant wind farm to
        power the electricity needs of the USA?

                                      ELECTRIC CHARGE
                                      Some particles have an electric charge. For example, the electron has a negative charge.
                                      In SI units, electric charge is measured in coulombs (C) and the amount of charge on a single
                                      electron in these units is —1.6 x 107!9C.

                                            e=-16x10°%C

                                      This means that you would have one coulomb of negative charge if you collected together
                                      6.25 x 108 electrons, as shown in this calculation:

                                            total charge, Q = ne = 6.25 x 10'®x -1.6 x 10°'9 =-1C

                                      The charges on fundamental particles such as electrons are fixed properties of these particles.
                                      It is impossible to create or destroy charge — the total charge must always be conserved.

                                      If electric charge moves, this is referred to as an electric current, and the definition of current is the
    strikes can have currents of
    10 000 amperes.                   rate of movement of charge. As it is usually a physical movement of billions of tiny charged particles,
                                      such charge movements are often said to flow. Thinking of the flow of charge like the current in a river
                                      can be useful, and we will see later how current splits and recombines at circuit junctions in a manner
                                      that is like water flow. Also, as the total amount of water in a river at a given time does not change, even
                                      if the river splits, this again shows the conservation of charge.




                                      A   figB   We can measure electric current through a component using an ammeter connected in series.

                                      Electric current occurs when a charged particle, which is free to move, experiences an electric force.
                                      If it can move it will be accelerated by the force. This movement of charge forms the electric current.
                                      Most electric circuits are made from metal wiring in which there are electrons that are free to move.
                                      These conduction electrons then form the current.

                                      Any source of electrical energy can create an electric force in order to produce a current. In fig C,
                                      the cell causes the electric force experienced by the negative conduction electrons so they move
                                      through the metal — they are attracted to the positive anode of the cell.

 ELECTRICAL QUANTITIES                                                              4A.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT

CALCULATING CURRENT
The SI unit for electric current is the ampere, A. Current can be calculated from the equation:
                            charge passing a point (C)
                  (A) time for that charge to pass (s)
      current (A) =


                    |   we
                        ~ At
Thus one ampere (1 A) is the movement of one coulomb (1 C) of charge per second (1s).
For example, if the lightning in fig A takes 0.1 seconds to transfer 1150 coulombs of charge, we
could calculate the current in the lightning:

          _ AQ _ 1150
      |                    = 11500A
            At      0.1

The equation that defines electric current is often used in a rearranged form to find AQ, the amount
of charge that has moved through a component in a given time, At.

      AQ = IAt


 PRACTICAL SKILLS
Observing charge flow
We can monitor small movements of charge, to see how they form a current, using a hanging ball that will conduct electricity.




4 figD A ball ona           string can carry small numbers of electrons across a high voltage gap, and this current is measured using a spot galvanometer.

The high voltage set up across the air gap between the metal plates encourages negative electrons to want to move towards the positive side. The
hanging ball is painted with conducting paint and swings backwards and forwards across the gap. It carries a small quantity of electrons from one
metal plate to the other each time. We can measure this small movement of charge on a very sensitive ammeter. If we time the period of
oscillation of the moving ball and measure the tiny current, we can calculate how many electrons would pass across on each journey of the ball.
 If the ball is moving too fast to be timed by eye, then we can use a stroboscope to measure the frequency of oscillations.

Example calculation:
 lf the spot galvanometer registers 6.5 microamperes and the ball takes 2.0 milliseconds for one swing, how many electrons does it carry on each
pass from the negative plate to the positive one?

          AQ =I x At = 6.5 x 10°
                               2 x 10°
                                     = 13 x 10°C =13nC
          no of electrons per swing:
              AQ        -13x10°
            ~e@         -1.6x 1079
          N = 8.1 x 10'° electrons
Note that on the ball’s return journey it will be positively charged, having lost an excess of electrons when contacting the positively charged plate.
However, positive charge moving in the opposite direction still is a current, and it will be at the same rate - the same current - because the ball
speed is constant.




 E  afety Note: The Van de Graaff generator will give unpleasant electric shocks but these should not harm healthy individuals. Anyone with a

VOLTAGES
The electrical quantity voltage is a measure of the amount of energy a component transfers per unit
of charge passing through it. It can be calculated from the equation:

ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE
For a supply voltage — a component which is putting electrical energy into a circuit — the correct
term for the voltage is electromotive force, or emf. If a cell supplies one joule (1 J) of energy per
coulomb of charge (1 C) that passes through it, it has an emf of 1 volt (1 V).                                      —

For example, if the bicycle lamp in fig A was powered by a cell with an emf of 1.5 V, then this cell
would transfer 1.5 J of electrical energy to each coulomb of charge that passed through it.

POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
For a component which is using electrical energy in a circuit and transferring this energy, the correct
term for the voltage is potential difference, or pd. If a component uses one joule (1 J) of energy
per coulomb of charge (1 C) that passes through it, it has a pd of 1 volt (1 V). The energy being used
by the component could be referred to as work done, W.

The ski lift takes skiers to the top of the slope — it gives them potential energy like a battery transfers
electrons electrical energy. From there, they can slide down a number of possible routes — like
separate, parallel, loops in a circuit. If the skier does a trick off an obstacle, then we could imagine
that he was passing through a component and transferring energy to the component. We could think
about measuring the emf of the chairlift, and the pd of each obstacle on the run.

Notice that although the picture in fig D has skiers and snowboarders, for simplicity we only refer
to ‘skiers’. This is a weakness of the model, as both would represent charge carriers flowing in our
circuit, but usually electric circuits have only one type of charge carrier that flows — the electrons.

CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS
For an electric circuit design, we need to know how components will react when the pd across them
changes, in order to ensure that the circuit performs its intended function under all circumstances.
Part of the specification of any component is a graph of its /—V characteristics. We have already
seen the graph for a simple resistor, and a metal at constant temperature would produce the same
straight-line result. The only difference would be that the gradient will be different in each case, as it
corresponds to the specific resistance of the resistor or wire.

For the filament lamp /—V graph in fig C, we can see that for a small voltage, the current is
proportional to it, as shown by the straight-line portion of the graph through the origin. At higher
voltages, a larger current is driven through the lamp filament wire, and this heats it up. At hotter
temperatures, metals have higher resistance. The gradient of the graph in fig B was given as the
reciprocal of the resistance, and so the gradient here becomes less towards higher voltages: higher
resistance means a lower gradient. In Section 4A.5, we will see why the resistance increases with

A   figD A semiconductor diode is designed to only pass current in one direction, so the line follows the x-axis, | = 0,

For the diode in fig D, we can see the basic idea that a diode only conducts in the forwards direction,
and so there is zero current for negative voltages. It also requires a minimum voltage in the forwards
direction. This threshold voltage is typically around 0.6 V. The curve for a diode will be looked at in
detail in Section 4A.6, which covers the ideas of electrical conduction in different materials.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 @ Explain conduction in metals.
 ®@ Explain electrical resistance.
 ®@ Calculate the drift velocity of conduction electrons in metals.


In order to conduct electricity, solids need to have electrons that are delocalised from the solid’s atoms, so
that they can move through the solid causing an overall movement of charge — a current.


CONDUCTION IN METALS
The structure of metals has a regular lattice of metal atoms. These are bonded together through
the sharing of electrons, which act as if they were associated with more than one atom. Many of the
atoms also have an outer electron that is not needed for bonding between the atoms. These free
electrons have a random motion, which changes as they collide with atoms or other electrons, but on
average the overall position of all the charge in the metal is stationary. However, if a source of emf is
connected across the metal, the electric field it sets up in the metal will push the negative electrons
towards the positive end of the field. The slow overall movement of the electrons is called their
drift velocity.

If we consider the cylinder shaded on the diagram in fig B as the
length of the wire that the charges move through in a time As, then
we need to calculate how much charge flows through it in that
time. There are n electrons per cubic metre of this metal, and the
wire has a cross-sectional area, A. Their movement is at a drift
velocity, v, and the distance this takes them along the wire in that
time is Ax. So: Ax = vAt.                                                                                                    crystal

RESISTIVITY
Table A in Section 4A.4 showed the resistivity of various materials, good conductors,
semiconductors and insulators (which are discussed in detail in Section 4A.6). It also showed
how the resistivity varies with temperature for metals and semiconductors. The resistivity of
semiconductors was seen to fall as the temperature rises. Table A below shows how the density
of conduction electrons, n in the transport equation, explains why the resistivity of metals is so
much lower than for semiconductors. The negative temperature coefficients of resistivity for
semiconductors show that their resistivity falls as the temperature goes up. The reason for this
is that the value for n in the transport equation will be higher at higher temperatures (see also
Section 4A.6). So the fact that the resistivity goes down is just a consequence of the fact that
these materials, like silicon, conduct better at higher temperatures.

A slight decrease in n for metals at higher temperatures is due to their thermal expansion, rather than
any change in the number of available conduction electrons. It is not as significant as the increase in
collisions between metal atoms and conduction electrons caused by increased thermal vibrations.

                               CONDUCTION IN SEMICONDUCTORS
                               Semiconductors are generally solid materials that only have small numbers of delocalised electrons
                               that are free to conduct. A typical example is silicon, one of the most common elements on Earth.

                               Free atoms have a series of discrete energy levels in which we can find their electrons, depending on
                               the energy the electrons have received (see Section 3D.4). If the electron receives enough energy, it
                               will leave the atom altogether, leaving behind an ion.

                               In solid materials, where there are many, many atoms close together, the allowed energy levels
                               become much wider, forming energy bands. The electrons can have a large range of energies and still
                               be within the same band. There are energy amounts which are forbidden for the electrons, but it is a
                               very different situation from the highly limited energy levels of the isolated atom’s electrons. As these
                               energy bands are created by the collective grouping of the solid’s atoms, the bands are attributed
                               to the semiconductor as a whole rather than to individual atoms. There is an energy level called
                               the valence band. Electrons with this amount of energy remain tied to atoms and do not form
                               part of any electric current. Those that gain energy to jump up to the conduction band become
                               delocalised and can move through the semiconductor as part of a current.

                               A   figA The gaps between energy bands within materials explain why they are conductors or insulators. If there is a
                                   large energy gap, electrons will need to gain a lot of energy to leave their atoms and conduct a current.


                               The number of delocalised electrons in a semiconductor is low compared with metals, and so
                               the current they will carry is therefore lower than metals for the same applied voltage. At higher
                               temperatures they have more conduction electrons, as more electrons are elevated into the
                               conduction band. There will be a temperature-related reduction in current due to increased collisions
                               with fixed atoms, but the increase in available conduction electrons is a much bigger effect. Overall,
                               a semiconductor will carry more current as the temperature goes up — its resistivity effectively drops
                               as the temperature rises.

CONDUCTION ‘HOLES’
When an electron enters the conduction band and moves away, this leaves the atom with a positive
charge. The empty space the electron has left is referred to as a (positive) hole. If an electron from
another atom moves to fill the hole, leaving its original atom with a hole, the hole has then moved.
As the electrons will be attracted to jump in the positive direction of an applied voltage, the hole
will slowly appear to move in the opposite direction. A positive hole moving towards the negative
cathode is like another charge carrier, adding to the current flow in a semiconductor It is like the
current flow in electrolysis, where positively and negatively charged particles are moving in opposite
directions at the same time.


 LEARNING TIP
 Note that conduction by holes does not mean there is overall movement of the positive metal ions.
The holes are an absence of an electron, and it is this space that moves as electrons actually jump in the
 opposite direction.



/-V CHARACTERISTICS OF A SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE
A diode is made by joining different types of semiconductors, which normally creates an energy barrier
at the junction between them. This blocks the movement of charge carriers (holes and electrons) across
the barrier This barrier can be overcome in the forward direction if a small forward voltage is applied.
In the reverse direction, only very few charge carriers can pass through at low voltages. They account
for a tiny ‘leakage current’. Once the reverse voltage becomes large enough, it can overcome the large
reverse energy barrier and force the conduction process in the opposite direction.

LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTORS (LDRS) AND THERMISTORS
Light dependent resistors have the property that their resistance depends on the light level
around them. In brighter conditions, the LDR will have a lower resistance. LDRs are made from
semiconductor material, and light landing on the material can boost electrons from the valence
energy band up to the conduction band, increasing the number of conduction electrons. The effect
of this is to make the LDR conduct better — it has a lower resistance.

Thermistors work in exactly the same way, except that their resistance depends on thermal
energy from the surroundings. The most common type of thermistors are referred to as negative
temperature coefficient thermistors. These use thermal energy to boost their electrons into the
conduction energy band, meaning their resistance falls as the temperature rises.
166   4A.6 SEMICONDUCTORS                                                ELECTRICAL QUANTITIES

                            INSULATORS
                            Electrical insulators can be thought of as materials in which the energy gap between the valence
                        band and the conduction band is so large that there are virtually zero electrons available for
                        conduction. There will therefore be no conduction holes either. A very large input of energy is
                        required in order to make the material conduct. Often this results in melting, or other damage, before
                        the material becomes electrically conducting. For example, glass is normally an excellent electrical
                        insulator, but a very high electric field, more than 10 million volts per metre, created across glass can
                            cause it to become conducting.


                        SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
                            Resistance increases with higher temperatures, because the higher level of internal energy in the
                            material causes more vibration of the fixed ions. These ions collide more often with charge carriers
                        to reduce their speed of movement through the material. Reducing the temperature therefore
                            reduces resistance, allowing greater current flow.




                            A   figC   If we cool a conductor, the current through it is seen to increase because its resistance drops.


                            Cooling to ever lower temperatures continues this trend, until something quite unexpected happens.
                            Below a certain critical temperature, the resistance suddenly drops to zero. This is called
                            superconductivity. The critical temperature varies with material, but for most metals it will be
                        below —243 °C. Complex ceramic superconductors have been created that have temperatures at
                            which they conduct without any resistance as high as —135 °C.

                            Superconductors are especially useful in applications where a large current is needed, as a large
                            current would normally waste too much energy or damage the surroundings with the heat dissipated.
                            For example, the strong magnets needed in a particle accelerator will often be superconducting
                            electromagnets, cooled to very low temperatures to maintain their superconductivity. The
                            electromagnets in the Large Hadron Collider operate at about 1.9 K.


                             DID YOU KNOW?
                             Low temperatures are often expressed on the Kelvin temperature scale, where 0 Kelvin (K) is referred
                             to as Absolute Zero.

                             We usually ignore the 0.15° and convert from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273 °. Absolute Zero is the
                             lowest temperature possible, as this represents a temperature where the particles have zero internal
                             energy.

A    figD   Superconductors can levitate magnets, as they do not accept penetration by magnetic fields. This is the
     Meissner Effect.



CHECKPOINT

1.     Explain why a piece of silicon semiconductor will have a lower resistance at a higher temperature.

2.     ‘The critical temperature for superconductivity for lead is 7.2 K’. Explain what this statement means.

3.) Some types of glass have been manufactured that do conduct electricity. Suggest and explain what                  4]Rm CRITICAL THINKING
       properties impurities might have in these glasses to make them less insulating than standard glass.




WORKED EXAMPLE
semiconductors materials with a lower resistivity than insulators, but higher than conductors. They usually
only have small numbers of delocalised electrons that are free to conduct
valence band a range of energy amounts that electrons in a solid material can have which keeps them
close to one particular atom
conduction band a range of energy amounts that electrons in a solid material can have which delocalises
them to move more freely through the solid
critical temperature the temperature below which a material's resistivity instantly drops to zero
superconductivity the electrical property of a material having zero resistivity

     A smartphone uses over a billion tiny electrical circuits in order to perform a huge range of functions. However,
     it is basically powered by a DC battery that will supply a continuous voltage of approximately 4 volts. From this
     single electrical quantity, the billion or more circuits can each be powered separately to perform their individual
     function.

      For the complex machines we use every day, the individual components need particular currents and voltages in
     order to function properly. In order to ensure that they receive appropriate currents and voltages, we must
     connect them together in circuits of the correct design and with other components. The design of the overall
     circuit, and designs of parts of it, rely on the calculations of the electrical properties at each point in the circuit.

      In this chapter, you will learn how the fundamental electrical quantities change around different parts of a
     circuit, and how they can be altered by the design of the circuit.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Calculate currents, voltages and resistances in series and parallel circuits.
MTM@ Derive the equations for combining resistances in series and parallel.


                               The most important rules governing measurements in electrical circuits are the conservation of
                               charge and conservation of energy. These determine how currents, voltages and resistances change
                               around any particular circuit.



                               CURRENT
                               The total amount of charge within a circuit cannot increase or decrease when the circuit is
                               functioning.


                                LEARNING TIP
                                Currents are measures of charge flow through a component, so they must be measured in the
                                same line as the component, i.e. the ammeter must always be placed in series next to the component.

                               CURRENTS IN SERIES CIRCUITS
                               Any group of components that follow in series in a circuit, with no junctions in the circuit, must have
                               the same current through them all.

                               CURRENTS IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS
                               Whenever a current encounters a junction in a circuit, the charges can only go one way or the other,
                               so the current must split. The proportions that travel along each possible path will be in inverse
                               proportion to the resistance along that path. If the path has high resistance, the current is less likely
                               to go that way. However, the total along the branches must add up to the original total current.

VOLTAGES IN SERIES CIRCUITS
Any group of emfs that follow in series in a circuit, with no junctions in the circuit, will have a total
emf that is the sum of their individual values, that accounts for the direction of their positive and
negative sides. For example, two 1.5 V cells in a TV remote control will be in series, so that they
supply an emf of 3.0 V. This is also true for any string of potential differences in series.

Electric current rule: the algebraic sum of the currents entering
a junction is equal to zero:

      >I =0

In order to conserve electric charge, the sum of all the currents
arriving at any point (such as a junction) in a circuit is equal to the
sum of all the currents leaving that point.

In fig D, we can confirm the voltages rule around the upper closed

only emf is the cell, and this will have an emf of 4.5 V, as shown
on the voltmeter at the bottom of the diagram.

Ammeters have zero resistance, and so A, contributes nothing to
the sum of pds. The current must be the same through the lamp
and the variable resistor, so the sum of the potential differences
will be calculated from:

                                  We have seen that all the voltage supplied by emfs in a circuit loop must be used by components as
                                  potential differences at other points around the circuit loop. The way that the voltage splits up is in
                                  proportion to the resistances of the components in the circuit loop, as shown in fig B. The voltages
                                  across the two resistors must add up to 6 V. The 20 21 resistor has twice the resistance, so takes twice
                                  the voltage of the 10          resistor. This is a potential divider circuit.

                                                               6V

A   figA Fixed emfs can be
    problematic when components
    require a lower voltage.                           V                 V

                                  A   figB     All of the 6 volts supplied by the battery must be used up by the resistors. The total pd of 6V is split into 2 V
                                      and 4V    in proportion to their resistances. Ammeters have zero resistance, so transfer zero energy and have zero pd.


                                  Ohm’s law explains why the voltage is split in proportion to the resistance. Consider the resistances
                                  and voltages in fig B in more general terms, as R, (for the 10                  resistor) and FR, and their
                                  corresponding pds V;, and V;. This will make the calculation valid for all values of resistances, and
                                  calculating the current through each one gives:

                                         I, = z and /,= z
                                  However, they both have the same current passing through them, so J; = J).

                                         Vv, _ V2
                                         R, Ry
                                         Vi     _R,
                                         Vv, R
                                  So the voltage is split in the same proportion as the ratio of the resistances for any values of resistance.

                                  This means that for a known emf supply voltage, we can use carefully chosen resistances to share
                                  the voltage and provide a specific value of pd on one component. If we then also remember that
                                  all parallel branches in a circuit must have the same voltage, then any branch we set up in parallel
                                  with that specific pd will also have the same voltage. So, we can set up a circuit to provide an exactly
                                  chosen value of voltage to the parallel branch. Using variable resistors, this set up can then be used
                                  to provide whatever voltage we choose. This can be particularly useful if our emf source is a fixed
                                  value, like a battery, which can only supply, say, 6 V.

A    figC     Adjusting the variable resistor alters the proportion of the voltage it takes, and so the pd that is left for the
      resistance wire can be varied to any value we choose.

In Section 4A.3, we saw graphs of current against potential difference for various components. In
order to undertake the investigation to produce these data, a potential divider circuit could be used.
Fig C shows a piece of resistance wire for which the current and voltage can be measured. If the
variable resistor is set to a high resistance, then it will have a high potential difference, and only a
small voltage will be left for the test wire. By decreasing the resistance of the variable resistor, the pd
across the test wire will increase. We can then adjust the variable resistor to set the values of pd on
the test wire to those we need for the /—V plot.


THE POTENTIAL DIVIDER EQUATION
As the pd in a potential divider circuit is split in proportion to the resistances of the components, we
can calculate the pd across them mathematically.

                          THE POTENTIOMETER




                          A     figE   A potentiometer allows us to supply any voltage up to the maximum provided by our emf source.


                          The idea of using a potential divider to supply a variable voltage as required has been incorporated
                          into an electrical component called the potentiometer. A moveable contact can slide over a fixed
                          length of resistance wire which adjusts the length that is on either side of this ‘wiper’. The two
                          lengths of wire are the two resistors in our potential divider circuit. Adjusting their relative lengths
                          alters their relative resistances and the voltage across each. If we want to power a separate circuit
                          with a variable voltage, we connect it across one side of the potentiometer. This is shown in fig F,
                          where we would connect the right-hand side connections across F, to our main circuit. The blocks
                          marked FR, and R, are a continuous piece of resistance wire, which will be split into two resistances
                          by the position of the wiper. Adjusting the wiper up and down allows us to have any desired voltage
                          up to the maximum of V, upply-

                                the wiper.



                          POTENTIAL DIVIDERS IN SENSOR CIRCUITS
                          If one of the resistors in a potential divider is a sensor component (such as thermistor or LDR) then
                          we can use its changing resistance to control an external circuit.

In fig G, the lamp is in parallel with the LDR, so will be powered by the same voltage as that across
the LDR. The resistance of a LDR increases if the ambient light level drops (darker surroundings
make its resistance go up). In bright conditions, the LDR has a very low resistance, so it takes a very
small proportion of the 12 V supplied by the battery. This will make the lamp very dim, probably
so much that it will appear to be off; it is not needed if the surroundings are bright. As conditions
become darker, the LDR resistance goes up, increasing the proportion of the 12 V supplied that drop
across it. This increases the voltage across the bulb, and makes it brighter. This circuit increases the
brightness of the lamp as the surroundings become darker

Many electronic components have a switch-on voltage of 5 V. These could be used with a sensor in a
potential divider circuit, and would only switch on when the sensor's resistance reached a level where
its pd was 5 V. Altering the resistor in this circuit would then control the sensor level at which the
electronic component was switched on.

TM@ Describe an investigation to determine an emf's internal resistance.
®@ Make calculations of internal resistance.


                                 All components have some resistance. The best ammeters have such a small resistance that
                                 the effect on their current measurements can be ignored, but it is not actually zero. Sources of
                                 electromotive force (emf), such as batteries, will also have a small, but non-zero, resistance. The
                                 resistance of an emf source is called its internal resistance. In most situations, the internal
                                 resistance of an emf source will not affect the performance of a circuit. It may not even be
                                 noticeable. However, as the power lost — energy wasted as heat — through a component increases
                                 with the current through it (see Section 4B.5), there can be a significant power loss when large
                                 currents are used. The net effect of this energy transfer by the emf source itself will be for it to

                                     series with the emf.


                                 The effect of having an internal resistance is that an emf will never be able to fully supply its
                                 maximum voltage. There will always be a small drop in voltage over the internal resistance and this
                                 drop will be bigger with a higher current. The pd over the internal resistance, r, can be found from
                                 Ohm’s law:

                                       |        =Ir
                                 This pd is sometimes referred to as ‘lost volts’, as the circuit appears to have fewer volts in use by
                                 the load than the emf should be supplying. A measurement of voltage across the terminals of a cell
                                 powering a circuit would not measure the emf; it would measure the emf minus the lost volts. This
                                 ‘terminal pd’ would then be:

                                       Vere =e-lr
                                 As all parallel branches have the same voltage across them, the terminal pd would also equal the pd
                                 across the load resistance.

The measurement of voltages in electric circuits has shown us that
these deal with the transfer of energy by components. As we saw
in Section 1B.2, energy must always be conserved, and electric
circuits are no exception to this. When components transfer
electrical energy to other useful stores, they can be considered to
be doing work, as this is defined as a transfer of energy.

A     figC   Modern electrical appliances come with a label indicating their efficiency, so that consumers can choose
      good value for running costs when making purchases.

From the equations above, we can easily calculate the work and power of electrical devices.
However, this calculation isn’t meaningful if we do not also consider the purpose of the device. If
most of the energy is not actually transferred to a store that is useful to us, then the cost of that
electrical energy will be wasted. We saw in Section 1B.2 that the ability of a device to transfer
energy usefully is called efficiency.

                                   We can find the efficiency of an electric motor by measuring the electrical energy it transfers, and
                                   by comparing this with its useful energy output in lifting a mass against its weight to give the mass

                                   You switch on the motor and find the time (t) it takes to lift the known mass (m) through a fixed height (Ah).
                                   During the lifting process, you measure the average pd (V) across the motor and current through it (/) using
                                   an ammeter and a voltmeter. You use these measurements to calculate the total energy input and the
                                   useful energy output for use in the efficiency equation.

                                      useful energy output = gravitational potential energy gained = mgAh

MATHS SKILLS
      In order to be able to develop your skills, knowledge and understanding in Physics, you will need
      to have developed your mathematical skills in a number of key areas. This section gives more
      explanation and examples of some key mathematical concepts you need to understand. Further
      examples relevant to your International AS/A       level Physics studies are given throughout the book. In
      particular, the Working as a Physicist section explores important ideas about units and estimation.


      ARITHMETIC AND NUMERICAL COMPUTATION
      USING STANDARD FORM
      Dealing with very large or small numbers can be difficult. To make them easier to handle, you can
      write them in the format a x 10°. This is called standard form.

      To change a number from decimal form to standard form:

      © Count the number of positions you need to move the decimal point by until it is directly to the
         right of the first number which is not zero.

      e This number is the index number that tells you how many multiples of 10 you need. If the original
         number was a decimal, your index number must be negative.

      Here are some examples:

       DECIMAL NOTATION             | STANDARD FORM NOTATION
       0.000 000 012                  1.2 x 10-8
       15                             1.5 x 10!
       1000                           1.0 x 10?
       3 700 000                      3.7 x 106


       WORKED EXAMPLE
       Calculate the momentum of a bullet of mass 5.2 grams fired at a speed of 825ms'inkgms".
       The momentum of this bullet would be:
                p=mxv

                p=5.2 x 103 x 825
                p = 4290 x 10°
                p=4.29kgms"




      ALGEBRA
      CHANGING THE SUBJECT OF AN EQUATION
      It can be very helpful to rearrange an equation to express the variable that you are interested in in
      terms of the variables it is related to. Always remember that any operation that you apply to one side
      of the equation must also be applied to the other side.


       WORKED EXAMPLE
       Consider the following equation which relates v = velocity, u = initial velocity, a = acceleration and
       s = displacement:
                    v? = u? + 2as

       If we wished to rearrange this equation to make u the subject, we would first subtract 2as from each side
       to obtain:
                    v2 - 2as =u’
                                                                                        MATHS SKILLS         195


 Now to obtain the formula in terms of u, we have to ‘undo’ the square term by doing the opposite of
 Squaring for each side. In essence, we have to take the square root of each side:

          vu2 =\v2 - 2as
             u=\v" - 2as




HANDLING DATA
USING SIGNIFICANT FIGURES
Often when you do a calculation, your answer will have many more figures than you need. Using an
appropriate number of significant figures will help you to interpret results in a meaningful way.

Remember the ‘rules’ for significant figures:
e The first significant figure is the first figure which is not zero.

e Digits 1—9 are always significant.

e Zeros which come after the first significant figure are significant unless the number has already
   been rounded.

Here are some examples:

 EXACT NUMBER | TOONES-F.                   TO TWO S.F               TO THREE S.F

 45 678                  50.000               46 000                     45700

GRAPHS
UNDERSTAND THAT y = mx + c REPRESENTS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP
Two variables are in a linear relationship if they increase at a constant rate in relation to one another.
If you plotted a graph with one variable on the x-axis and the other variable on the y-axis, you would
get a straight line. Any linear relationship can be represented by the equation y = mx + c where the
gradient of the line is m and the value at which the line crosses the y-axis is c. An example of a
linear relationship is the relationship between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, which can
be represented by the equation F = 2C + 32 where C is temperature in degrees Celsius and Fis
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

                     DRAW AND USE THE SLOPE OF A TANGENT TO A CURVE AS A MEASURE OF A RATE OF CHANGE

                     Sir Isaac Newton was fascinated by rates of change. He drew tangents to curves at various points
                     to find the rates of change of graphs as part of his journey towards discovering the calculus — an
                     amazing branch of mathematics. He argued that the gradient of a curve at a given point is exactly
                     equal to the gradient of the tangent of a curve at that point.

                     Technique:

                     1       Use aruler to draw a tangent to the curve.

                     2       Calculate the gradient of the tangent using the technique given for a linear relationship. This is
                             equal to the gradient of the curve at the point of the tangent.

                     USING SIN, COS AND TAN WITH RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES

                     For a right-angled triangle, Pythagoras’ Theorem can be used to find the length of a side given the
                     length of two other sides. For problems that involve angles as well as side lengths, we can use the
                     ratios sine, cosine and tangent. These ratios are called trigonometric ratios.

                      WORKED EXAMPLE
                     A boat sails due east (090°) at    3ms~'. The tide comes from the south-east (135°) at 1 ms"!

                      Draw a vector diagram to show the movement of the boat over the ground and calculate the speed.

                     You need to draw a diagram that represents the information in the question. If you draw a scale diagram,
                      choose a simple scale like 1 cm: 10m.


                                                                                              ims


                                                                                             45°

                                                                                3ms7'

                      Now we must split both of the vectors up into two components, one going north and one going east.

                      North The boat speed vector 3 ms"! has no component going north. The tide speed vector of 1 msTM' has
                      a component 1 ms”! x sin 45 = 0.707 ms"! going north.

                      East The boat speed vector 3 ms~' is going due east. The tide speed vector of 1         ms~' has a component
                      lms! x cos 45 = -0.707 ms~! going east; the minus sign means that the component is to the west and so
                     we must subtract it since it reduces the boat speed to the east. So the boat speed to the east is
                      (3 - 0.707) = 2.293 or 2.29msTM using 3 significant figures.

                      Now we must combine the north and east components to find the net speed. You recognise a right angle
                      triangle. You need to use Pythagoras.

                              (speed)? = 0.7072 + 2.292 = 0.500 + 5.24 = 5.74
                             so speed = ¥5.74 = 2.40ms"!.

(c)   Take measurements from the graph to show that the gradient m of
      the line of best fit is about m = 11.7Qm"' and hence calculate a
      value for the resistivity of the metal of the wire.


(a)   You need to recall the equation of a straight line y = mx + c
      where the data is plotted on the x and y axes and m          is the
      gradient and c is the intercept on the y-axis.

      You must then compare this with the equation for resistivity
      where he has measured R and |.

      Since R = p a we can see that if R is plotted on the y-axis
      and | on the x-axis then the gradient of the line will be r
      which is a constant so the line will be straight. There are no
      other terms in the resistivity equation so the value for c will be
      zero and the line should pass through the origin.

      Note that the origin is not marked on this graph, it starts at (0.4,
      40)

(b)   You need to remember the formula for the area of a circle
      A=1xr
      Note you can only measure the diameter of a piece of wire so
      you must divide by 2 to get the radius r.

(c)   Take measurements from the graph to show that the gradient
      m of the line of best fit is about m = 11.7 Om! and hence
      calculate a value for the resistivity of the metal of the wire.

      Gradient = rise over run, so take measurements from the line of

COMMENTARY
This is a weak answer because:
e    The phrase ‘more dangerous’ does not explain a specific event

     that will be dangerous and more likely at higher speeds.

e    The student needs to explain the physics behind why these

     dangerous events become more likely at higher speeds.

e    This student’s mention of momentum does not follow up with
     why momentum increase means cars take longer to stop, and
     so it would not score a mark.

e    There must be at least one benefit explained in order to score

     further marks.
