niche markets is Zumiez, which sells products related to
surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding. However, if a
business successfully exploits a niche market it still may
attract competition. Niche markets, by their nature, are
very small and unable to support many competing firms.
As a result, if a large business decides to enter a niche
market they may find it easy to overrun a smaller rival.
Also, businesses that rely on a single niche market may
be vulnerable because they are not spreading their risk. If
they lose a grip in their chosen market, they may collapse
because they do not have other products or markets as a
back-up.

   Figure 3 shows that global sales of EVs in 2016 was
   774,000 units. This was 42 per cent higher than
 for 2015. Sales of EVs grew 20 times faster than
 the overall vehicle market, however, this was only
  0.86 per cent of the total market for vehicles. By the
  end of 2016, the number of EVs on the road passed
   2 million. Of these 61 per cent were pure EVs and
   39 per cent were hybrids. As Figure 4 shows, China
   is currently the most important market. It also plays a
  leading role in the manufacturing of EVs.

This section focuses on the forces of demand and supplyin markets. It looks at the ann that
influence demand, such as consumer incomes and the prices of substitutes and complementary
goods. It also examines the factors that influence supply, such as production costs, indirect taxes
and government subsidies. The section looks at how prices are determined in markets by the
interaction of supply and demand. It also explores the responsiveness of demand to both changes

DEMAND
Demand is the amount of a product that consumers are
willing and able to purchase at any given price. Demand
is concerned with what consumers are actually able
to buy (what they can afford to and would buy), rather
than what they would like to buy. So, for example, we
could say that the demand for cars in the Australian
market at an average price of AUD 20,000 might be
90,000 a year.
     Table 1 shows a demand schedule for button
mushrooms. These figures can be used to draw a
demand curve as in Figure 1. In practice, demand curves                          20         40         60         80    100

            ANALYSIS




Global Care Group is an Australian not-for-profit
organisation that has been caring for elderly and disabled
people for over 20 years. The organisation is run by
a voluntary, elected board of management, members
of which are selected based on their commitment and
achievements in the aged-care sector. The organisation
focuses on providing premium care and not maximising
(prioritising) profit.
   Global Care's first move into the sector was in 1991
when it opened Morrison Lodge Midland. However,
the group now offers a wide range of care services
for the elderly including retirement living, day care and
community care in the Wheatbelt and Midland region in
Western Australia. Morrison Lodge can accommodate
over 70 residents and has purpose-built facilities to
cater for a variety of elderly people with different needs.
Close to the lodge there is a day care centre, Hamersley
House, and independent living village, Struckman Mews.
                                                                      1970          2010         2020          2030         2040          2050

 this promise in November and December, the number
 of approvals for new houses fell by 9.6 per cent and
 7.2 per cent, respectively.
     The shortage in the supply of houses is causing
 house prices and rents to rise sharply and for many
 people housing is becoming unaffordable. The housing
 shortages are being caused by growing immigration
 and inadequate supply. The supply of new houses,
 particularly in Auckland, is being restricted by a lack
 of suitable land and an overworked building industry,
 which has been described as badly managed,
 disordered and dishonest. Some of the production
 costs associated with construction, such as land and
 labour are also high.

In the past, members of OPEC have been able to form
agreements that restrict oil production and therefore limit
global supply. This has driven up the price. More recently
such agreements have not been made. OPEC members
supply around 80 per cent of the world’s oil.
     Supply has also increased because Iran, a major
world producer, has been allowed to sell more oil in the
market. Iran was subject to sanctions from world powers
that prevented it from selling oil. However, the sanctions
were lifted recently when Iran reduced its development of
nuclear facilities.
     The supply of oil has also increased due to the
discovery of new sources. In recent years the USA has
started to extract oil from shale (a type of rock) using
a process called fracking. For example, in 2017 the

In recent years the Chinese economy has grown
significantly (Figure 1). Many people have benefited from
the growth in manufacturing and a significant proportion
of China's population has become wealthier. As a result
the number of Chinese people taking holidays abroad has
increased dramatically. Figure 2 shows the growth in the
number of Chinese people crossing borders for holidays
between 2010 and 2015.
      In 2016, the most popular destination for Chinese
tourists was the administrative region of Hong Kong.
More than 35 million Chinese tourists visited the region.
Other popular destinations included Macau, Thailand,

their designs. Ethical sourcing means that businesses
only use materials, components and services from
suppliers that respect the environment, treat their
workforce well by paying them a fair wage and
providing a safe working environment, and generally
trade with honesty. For example, a clothes designer
might insist that their collections are not manufactured
by overseas businesses that use child labour in their
factories.
   In 2016, a US retailer called BJ's Wholesale Club,
joined a boycott on cotton from Uzbekistan. The company
discovered that cotton production in Uzbek involved the
use of forced labour. According to a press release, ‘The
Uzbek government forces over 1 million citizens to labour
in the country’s cotton fields each year. The government
shuts down universities and public offices for months at
atime, mobilises the country’s students, teachers, and
civil servants, and sends them to the cotton fields every
autumn.’

amount of waste on site, and the management of waste

end up in their completed buildings, because the parts
of each building are created to fit the exact size of the

 CASE STUDY: WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE

 The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is the
 largest independent conservation organisation in the
 world. Its mission is to create a world where people
 and wildlife can exist together. One of the ways in
 which the organisation tries to influence people's
 behaviour towards wildlife is to use poster campaigns.
 The poster shown was used by the WWF to raise
 awareness about global warming and the impact it
 might have on the planet.

PREDATORY PRICING
Predatory pricing or destroyer pricing aims to eliminate
competitors from the market. It involves charging a very
low price for a period of time until one or more rivals
leave the market. In many countries some forms of
predatory pricing are illegal. This is when a business is
selling a product below the cost of production with the
deliberate aim of forcing a competitor out of the market.
This practice is illegal because in the long term it can lead
to a lack of competition in a market. As a result, if all firms
have left the market except for the predator, the price is
likely to be raised beyond the initial level.
   Such low-price strategies are allowed if low-cost
businesses are prepared to endure low profit margins
for extended periods of time. They can also be used to
sell stocks that would otherwise remain unsold or as a
means of breaking into a new market.

keep chains as short as possible.


SPAN OF CONTROL
The number of people, or subordinates, a person directly
controls in a business is called the span of control. For

their span of control is ten. If a business has a wide span
of control it means that a person controls relatively more
subordinates. Someone with a narrow span of control

he does not report to anyone and no one reports to him.
He says, ‘We're free to choose to work on whatever we
think is interesting. People ask you questions about what
you are working on. Staff are encouraged to be open and
appreciate that they are interdependent.’
      Employees at Valve are encouraged to move around
the office and to interact with their work colleagues. In
fact, furniture in the Valve offices is on wheels to make
moving around easier. There are even instructions in the
Valve staff handbook that show employees how to move
their desks. This is shown in Figure 5. Powers, who has
probably moved his desk ten times in 3 years, said,
‘We form into teams based on the need to complete a
feature or complete a game, and then we disperse into

spices that would go well with these particular foods.
However, her herbs and spices offered better quality, with
health benefits, and at an affordable price.

that might be pursued when trading conditions become
difficult due to more competition or an economic
downturn. However, some businesses look to cut costs
all of the time. If costs are lower, profit margins will be
higher. Businesses with lower costs might also gain a
competitive edge in the market.
   A business can use a variety of methods to cut costs.
It might:
   e    lay off staff to cut labour costs
   e    find new suppliers to get cheaper resources
   e    increase the usage of recycled materials
   e    develop new working practices that use fewer
        resources

   e    develop ways of saving energy.
One of the drawbacks of cutting costs is that product
quality or customer service might suffer. For example,
if a cafe cuts down on staff to reduce costs, customers
might get fed up waiting for their food and go somewhere

  1. Firms often have to consider the trade-off between holding liquid assets and investing more in productive assets, such as
     machinery. By reducing the amount of liquid assets held, there is a risk of cash flow problems. However, investing more in
     productive assets may increase profitability.

  2. Directors of public limited companies have to find the right balance when distributing corporate profits. They can reinvest profits and
     hopefully increase future profitability. However, shareholders may prefer higher current dividend payments and less reinvestment.

  3. Firms might choose to take a more ethical approach to their operations. However, this is likely to come at a cost, as investment
     in cleaner technology might be required, for example.

  4. A common trade-off is that between higher profit margins or higher turnover. Some businesses can often sell more and raise
     turnover, but this may come at the expense of lower prices and reduced profit margins.

                                                          Firms need money to get started. They might need to buy

                                                          Once this initial expenditure has been met, the business can

                                                          A business will need to find a way of raising this finance.

company in New York for 10 years. However, the
US company he worked for was taken over, and the

 CASE STUDY: CARREFOUR

 France-based Carrefour is an international retail chain
 with around 12,000 stores. It sells groceries, a few
 non-grocery lines and has three different types of
 stores — supermarkets, convenience stores, and cash
 and carry outlets. It also has online services that
 incorporate a click and collect operation. In 2016, the
 organisation had a turnover of €85,700 million and
 was Europe's largest supermarket chain.
      A significant part of Carrefour's revenue results
 from a franchising operation. Over 7000 convenience
 stores are run by franchisees. For an initial cost of                        1. Explain the difference between a franchisor and a

EXAM HINT

 If you are assessing the impact of going public on a particular company, you will need to demonstrate your ability
 to evaluate. It will be helpful to build your answer around any information given that is specific to the company, to
 show your skills in application. When you have analysed the advantages and disadvantages of going public you will
 need to make a judgement. This will depend on the information in the case. However, one approach might be to
 suggest that some stakeholders will benefit, such as shareholders, and others might lose out, such as customers.
 Some people argue that this happened in the UK when some of the ‘old’ nationalised (state-owned) industries went
 public. For example, the price of shares in privatised water companies has grown well since their initial flotation,

 CASE STUDY: SALIM AND AMJAD QADIR

 Salim and Amjad Qadir own a thriving textile business
 located in the centre of the Karkhano market in
 Peshawar, Pakistan. The brothers buy textiles from a
 number of manufacturers in the country and sell to
 individual customers. However, the Qadirs have recently
 started to supply small dressmakers in the city. These
 traders are allowed to buy fabric on 60-day credit
 terms. Table 2 shows a 3-month cash flow forecast for
 the business in 2017. (Note that some of the figures are
 missing in the forecast.)

WAYS TO IMPROVE LIQUIDITY
Liquidity problems can be prevented by keeping a tight
control on financial resources. The use of budgets
and cash flow forecasts will improve the financial
management of a business. Inevitably though, there
will be occasions when firms run short. When this does
happen the firm's main aim will be survival rather than
profit. If a business is experiencing liquidity problems it
must raise current assets or reduce current liabilities or
both. The following measures might be used to either
generate cash or save it.

      Unfortunately, in 2016 the business failed owing
creditors more than AUD 260 million. The cause of the
failure was explained by a number of factors. First of
all the market was changing. An increasing number of
customers were buying online and competition from
rivals, such as Harvey Norman, was also fierce. According
to the company’s administrators the market changed.
They said, ‘The consumer electronics market is highly
competitive with rapid changes in consumer demand
patterns.’ This resulted in low margins for Dick Smith, a
decline in market share and slow revenue growth.
   Another problem that contributed to Dick Smith's
downfall was poor inventory control. In this case, the
stock held by the stores did not meet customer needs.
Consequently, the business was left with a lot of obsolete   (a)    Explain the difference between the internal and

IMPLICATIONS OF OVER-UTILISATION
Many businesses would prefer to operate at close to full
capacity because average costs are lower. However, if
a business is running at full capacity it might be over-
utilising its resources. This means that resources will be
stretched uncomfortably. For example, over-utilisation
might occur if people are being asked to work long
periods of overtime without a reasonable break for rest.
There are both drawbacks and benefits of over-utilisation.
       Drawbacks: The pressure of constantly working at
full capacity can put a strain on some of the resources.
As well as causing stress and tiredness to the workforce,
possibly increasing the risk of accidents or absence,

 When answering a question on capacity utilisation
 where a business has under-utilised capacity or is
 over-utilising capacity, you need to assess whether
 a business has long-term or short-term problems.
 For example, a business with seasonal demand,
 where under-utilisation is not permanent, will address
 problems slightly differently. Drawing distinctions
 between the long term and the short term in business
 will help show your skills for evaluation.

            The final section in Unit 2 addresses how external factors might impact on businesses. Some
            external factors are economic, such as interest rates, exchange rates and the rate of inflation.
            A second group of external factors is legislation, such as consumer protection, environmental
            protection, health and safety legislation, and competition policy. The third external factor is
         I competition and the effect that large numbers of competitors and very large organisations have

 CASE STUDY: BOLT

 In 2015, two entrepreneurs, Satyajeet Mohanty and
 Ronak Kumar Samantray, set up their own business,
 Bolt, in Hyderabad, India. They invented and developed
 a device for charging mobile phones while riding a
 motorbike. The device, called the Bolt Red Streak, is a
 small, waterproof mobile charger designed to charge
 any mobile safely and quickly on the bike. The unique
 removable design makes it easy to unplug and carry
 around when not riding. The device also tracks the
 entire ride on a route map and calculates total distance
 and average speed using the Bolt Riders App. It sells
 for INR 1599 and can be purchased online or from
 around 30 dealers.                                           The business hopes to sell 350 units per month in

             ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION,
             CRITICAL THINKING


The global car market is very competitive. It is dominated
by some large and powerful multinationals such as
Toyota, GM, VW, Renault-Nissan. In the first quarter of
2017 a total of 21.24 million passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles were sold around the world. The pie
chart in Figure 1 shows the market shares of the largest
manufacturers in the first quarter of 2017. Figure 2 shows
the amounts of money spent on advertising by a selected
group of car manufacturers in 2015.
      One of the small manufacturers operating in the car
industry is the electric car producer, Tesla. The founders
of Tesla wanted to prove that electric cars could be better                                               FCA,

                                            incomplete. An attempt at an assessment is presented that is
                                            unbalanced and unlikely to show the significance of competing
                                            arguments.

                                            effect(s). Assessment is balanced, well contextualised, using
                                            quantitative and/or qualitative information, and shows an awareness
                                            of competing arguments/factors.

Section C

In section C you will be given some business-related stimulus material (possibly one or more extracts). You
will need to answer Question 3 which is not broken down into parts. You will be expected to write an extended
answer — an essay. This means you will need to write a more detailed answer. This question will use the
command word ‘Evaluate’ and the essay will be worth 20 marks and will be marked using a level-based
marking grid. Your response must demonstrate a logical and coherent multi-stage chains of reasoning, which
needs to be developed with reference to context where appropriate. The validity and significance of
arguments/models and concepts should be considered and supported by relevant chains of reasoning. There
should also be a recognition of different viewpoints and/or a critical assessment of the evidence so that
informed judgements arguments may be made.
The level-based marking grid used Section C is given in the mark scheme in the International Advanced Level
Business Sample Assessment Materials on page 34:

PREPARING FOR EXAMS



Skills required when answering questions

One important element in your preparation for the Business AS Level examination (Paper 1 and Paper 2) is to understand the
skills required to be successful. You will need to demonstrate four different skills referred to as assessment objectives (AOs).

AO1 —- Knowledge: this means you have to show that you:
    *   recognise and understand business terms, concepts and theories;
    *   understand how individuals and organisations are affected by and respond to business issues.
    +   All questions will test knowledge to some extent. A minority of questions will test knowledge alone. These can be recog-
        nised by the mark allocation. They will tend to carry just two marks.
    * AOQ1 is worth 27.5% of the marks at International AS Level.

AO2 - Application: this means that you have to apply knowledge and understanding to various contexts to show how individ-
uals and organisations are affected by and respond to issues.
Examples of Application might include:
    *   using a business formula in appropriate circumstances, for example, calculating the price elasticity of demand for a
        product;
    *   using a theory to explain why a business has chosen a particular course of action;
    *   using a theory to explain the impact on a business of choosing a particular course of action.
    +   Most questions in the examination will require you to demonstrate application. This means that you have to ensure that
        your answers relate directly to the context given in the question. You must discuss the implications of issues to the par-
        ticular business or industry in the context you are given.
    *   AO2 is worth 25% of the marks at International AS Level.

AO3 - Analysis: this means you have to show that you can break down information and understand the implications of what
you have been presented with. You will need to show an understanding of the impact on individuals and organisations of ex-
ternal and internal influences.

Examples of analysis might include:
    +   identifying causes and effects and interrelationships, for example, recognise from a graph that sales are falling and could
        be the result of new competition in the market;
    *   breaking down information to identify specific causes or problems, for example, realise that a business is suffering ineffi-
        ciency because staff motivation has fallen as a result of a pay cut;
    *   using appropriate techniques to analyse data, for example, use financial ratios to assess the performance of a business;

You will often be required to construct an argument, by explaining the possible reasons for events or discussing the advantag-
es or disadvantages of particular courses of action, for example. Those questions which carry six marks or more will require
analysis in the answer. Some questions that carry four marks may also require you to demonstrate some analytical skills.
AO3 is worth 27.5% of the marks at International AS Level.

AO4 - Evaluation: evaluation involves making a judgement. You will need to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative evi-
dence to make informed judgements and propose evidence-based solutions to business issues.
Examples of evaluation might include:
    *   showing judgment when weighing up the relative importance of different points or sides of an argument, in order to
        reach a conclusion;
    *   drawing conclusions from the evidence that you present;
    *   assessing the relative importance of particular issues to a business;
    *   suggesting a course of action for a business supported with plausible motives or evidence.
When evaluating, it is often possible to draw a number of different conclusions. Very often in business studies there is no
‘right’ answer so examiners are likely to be more interested in whether your judgment     is plausible and the quality of your argu-
ment in support of that judgment. Questions that carry eight marks or more are likely to test evaluation.
AO4 is worth 20% of the marks at International AS Level.

General advice
You should familiarise yourself with the layout of the paper by looking at the sample assessment materials published by Edex-
cel. The questions within each section are followed by lined spaces where you should write your answer. Use the mark alloca-
tion as a guide to how much time to spend on each question. In each exam paper, you have to answer ALL questions. There
is no choice of questions. However, this can be an advantage because it means you do not have to waste time deciding which
questions to answer.
