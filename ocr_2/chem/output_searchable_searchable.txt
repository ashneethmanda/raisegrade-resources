 ABOUT THIS BOOK




       ABOUT THIS BOOK
       This book is written for students following the Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary (IAS)
       Chemistry specification. This book covers the full IAS course and the first year of the International A Level
       (IAL) course.

       The book contains full coverage of IAS units (or exam papers) 1 and 2. Students can prepare for the written
        Practical Paper by using the IAL Chemistry Lab Book (see page x of this book). Each unit has five Topic
       areas that match the titles and order of those in the specification. You can refer to the Assessment Overview
       on page xii for further information.

        Each Topic is divided into chapters and sections to break the content down into manageable chunks. Each
       section features a mix of learning and activities.

x       PRACTICAL SKILLS




    PRACTICAL SKILLS
    Practical work is central to the study of chemistry. The International Advanced Subsidiary (IAS) Chemistry specification
    includes eight Core Practicals that link theoretical knowledge and understanding to practical scenarios.

    Your knowledge and understanding of practical skills and activities will be assessed in all examination papers for the
    IAS Level Chemistry qualification.

    e    Papers 1 and 2 will include questions based on practical activities, including novel scenarios.

    e    Paper 3 will test your ability to plan practical work, including risk management and selection of apparatus.

    In order to develop practical skills, you should carry out a range of practical experiments related to the topics covered
    in your course. Further suggestions in addition to the Core Practicals are included in the specification which is available
    online.

    Studying chemistry at this level involves many skills. These skills include describing observations, giving
    explanations, planning and interpreting experiments. Although all of these skills are discussed in this topic, the
    most important feature of this part of the course involves using numbers. Some students have a natural ability
    for numbers, while others find them less attractive. Whatever your mathematical ability, it is important to
    spend as much time as possible focusing on this topic in order to improve.

    Using numbers accurately is an important skill in so many occupations - here are just a few examples:

      in medicine, calculating the dosage of a drug to maximise benefit to the patient and minimise unwanted
      side-effects

      in business, predicting whether capital investment will produce a sufficient incometojustify the investment

      in industry, considering whether the costs and polluting effects of   anew method of making a molecule
      justify making the change

      in shipping operations (for example, the Costa Concordia in 2012), working out the volume of air needed to
      float a ship after an accident.

    As far as your chemistry course is concerned, this topic is the foundation of success in other topics, such as
    energetics and kinetics.




      Use appropriate units and conversions, including for masses, gas and solution volumes

      Use standard and ordinary form, decimal places, and significant figures

After writing the correct formulae, balancing the equation and including state symbols, the equation is:

         2AgNO.(aq) + CaCl,(aq) — 2AgCl(s) + Ca(NO;).(aq)


ARROWS IN EQUATIONS
Most equations are shown with a conventional (left to right) arrow —>. However, some important
reactions are reversible. This means that the reaction can go both in the forward and backward (reverse)
directions. The symbol = is used in equations for these reactions. You can find guidance later in this
book (Topic 9B) about when this reversible arrow should be used.

Sometimes a conventional arrow is made longer to allow information about the reaction to be shown
above the arrow (and sometimes below it). This information might be about reaction conditions, such
as temperature, pressure and the use of a catalyst. In organic chemistry, where reaction schemes
are important, a label indicating, for example, Step 1, may be placed on the arrow in a sequence of
reactions.



IONIC EQUATIONS
SIMPLIFYING FULL EQUATIONS
Ionic equations show any atoms and molecules involved, but only the ions that react together, and
not the spectator ions.

This is the easiest method to follow for simplifying equations:

1     Start with the full equation for the reaction.

2     Replace the formulae of ionic compounds by their separate ions.

3     Delete any ions that appear identically on both sides.


 WORKED EXAMPLE 1
 What is the simplest ionic equation for the neutralisation of sodium hydroxide solution by dilute nitric acid?

 The full equation is:

          NaOH(aq) + HNO.(aq) + NaNO.(aq) + H,O(I)

You should now consider which of these species are ionic and replace them with ions. In this example, the
    first three compounds are ionic:

          Na*(aq) + OH (aq) + H*(aq) + NO3(aq) — Na*(aq) + NO3(aq) + H20(!)
After deleting the identical ions, the equation becomes:

          H*(aq) + OH (aq) > H;0(!)


 WORKED EXAMPLE 2
What is the simplest ionic equation for the reaction that occurs when solutions of lead(I!) nitrate and sodium
 sulfate react together to form a precipitate of lead(II) sulfate and a solution of sodium nitrate?

The full equation is:

          Pb(NO3)2(aq) + Na,SO,(aq) — PbSO,(s) + 2NaNO.(aq)

    Replacing the appropriate species by ions gives:

          Pb**(aq) + 2NO3(aq) + 2Na*(aq) + SOZ-(aq) — PbSO,(s) + 2Na*(aq) + 2NO3(aq)

After deleting the identical ions, the equation becomes:

          Pb**(aq) + SO7 (aq) — PbSO,(s)
These remaining ions are not deleted because they are not shown identically. Before the reaction they
were free-moving ions in two separate solutions (Pb** and SO7>). After the reaction they are joined
 together in a solid precipitate (PbSO,).

                                     WORKED EXAMPLE 3
                                     Carbon dioxide reacts with calcium hydroxide solution to form water and a precipitate of calcium carbonate.

                                     The full equation is:

                                           CO,(g) + Ca(OH),(aq) + CaCO,(s) + H2O(!)
                                     Replacing the appropriate species by ions gives:

                                           CO,(g) + Ca?*(aq) + 20H (aq) — CaCO,(s) + H2O(I)

                                    As with Reaction 1, you can see that this is s a redox reaction. Electrons are transferred from
                                    aluminium atoms to iron(III) ions, so aluminium atoms are oxidised (loss of electrons) and iron(III)
                                    ions are reduced (gain of electrons).

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    MTM Relate ionic and full equations, with state symbols, to observations from simple test-tube reactions, for precipitation
       reactions.


In this topic, we focus on two aspects of precipitation reactions:
¢    their use in chemical tests
¢    their use in working out chemical equations.


CHEMICAL TESTS
CARBON DIOXIDE
This may be your earliest memory of a precipitation reaction. When carbon dioxide gas is bubbled
through calcium hydroxide solution (often called limewater), a white precipitate of calcium carbonate
forms. The relevant equation is:

        Ca(OH),(aq) + CO,(g) — CaCO,(s) + H,O(I)

The formation of the white precipitate was probably described as the limewater going milky or cloudy.




A     fig A   Limewater is a colourless solution. As more carbon dioxide is bubbled through it, the amount of white
      precipitate increases.


SULFATES
The presence of sulfate ions in solution can be shown by the addition of barium ions (usually from
solutions of barium chloride or barium nitrate). The white precipitate that forms is barium sulfate.

For example, when barium chloride solution is added to sodium sulfate solution, the relevant
equations are:

        Na,SO,(aq) + BaCl,(aq) —- BaSO,(s) + 2NaCl(aq)

        SO2"(aq) + Ba**(aq) — BaSO,(s)

This test is covered in more detail in Topic 8B.4.

                         HALIDES
                         The presence of halide ions in solution can be shown by the addition of silver ions (from silver
                         nitrate solution). The precipitates that form are silver halides.

                         For example, when silver nitrate solution is added to sodium chloride solution, the relevant
                         equations are:

                                    NaCl(aq) + AgNO.(aq) — AgCl(s) + NaNO,(aq)

                                    Cl (aq) + Ag*(aq) > AgCl(s)
                         This test is covered in more detail in Topic 8C.4.


                         WORKING OUT EQUATIONS
                         A good example of using a precipitation reaction to work out an equation is the reaction between
                         aqueous solutions of lead nitrate and potassium iodide. Both reactants are colourless solutions.
                         When they are mixed, a yellow precipitate of lead iodide forms.

                         The word equation for this reaction is:

                                                 lead nitrate + potassium iodide — lead iodide + potassium nitrate

                         Here is an outline of the experiment.
                         ¢     Place the same volume of a potassium iodide solution in a series of test tubes.
                         ¢     Add different volumes of a lead nitrate solution to the tubes.
                         e     Place each tube in a centrifuge and spin the tubes for the same length of time.
                         ¢     Measure the depth of precipitate in each tube.

                         Table A shows the results of one experiment.

You can see that there is no increase in the amount of precipitate from tube 5 to tube 6. This shows
that the reaction is incomplete in tubes 1, 2, 3 and 4, but is complete in tube 5. The amounts, in
moles, of reactants used in tube 5 are calculated as follows:

      n(potassium iodide) = 0.005 x 1.0 = 0.005 mol

      n(lead nitrate) = 0.0025 x 1.0 = 0.0025 mol

This shows that lead nitrate reacts with potassium iodide in the ratio 1: 2.

The equations for the reaction are:

      Pb(NO3),(aq) + 2KI(aq) — PblI,(s) + 2KNO,(aq)

      Pb2*(aq) + 21-(aq) — Pbl.(s)

different elements. For this reason, they began to use the term              M, = 12.0 + (2 x 16.0) = 44.0
‘relative atomic mass’.

            REACTING MASSES
 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

TM Use chemical equations to calculate reacting masses and vice versa, using the concepts of amount of substance
   and molar mass.

M@ Determine a formula or confirm an equation by experiment, including evaluation of the data.



                             INTRODUCTION TO REACTING MASSES
                             You can use the ideas from previous topics about amounts of substance and equations to do
                             calculations involving the masses of reactants and products in equations.

                             A balanced equation for a reaction shows the same number of each species (atoms, molecules, ions
                             or electrons) on both sides of the equation. It is also balanced for the masses of each species. This
                             means that we can make predictions about the masses of reactants, which are needed to form a
                             specified mass or amount of a product, or the other way round.

                             Consider this equation used in the manufacture of ammonia:



                             This shows that one molecule of nitrogen reacts with three molecules of hydrogen to form two
                             molecules of ammonia.

                             This statement can be made about the amounts involved:

                                    1 mol of N, reacts with 3mol of H, to form 2mol of NHs.

                             This statement can be made about the masses involved:

                                    28.0 g of N, reacts with 6.0g of H, to form 34.0g of NH.

                             These amounts and masses can have many other values, as long as the ratio does not change.


                             CALCULATING REACTING MASSES FROM EQUATIONS
                             Using a balanced equation, predictions can be made about reacting masses.


                              WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                              The equation for a reaction is:

                              Step 1: calculate the molar masses of all substances you are told about and asked about, in this case,
                                      sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid

                              Step 2: calculate the amount of sulfuric acid

                                     n= Be            0.765 mol
                              Step 3: use the reaction ratio in the equation to work out the amount of sulfur trioxide needed

                              As the ratio is   1:1, the amount is the same, so n(SO3) = 0.765 mol
                              Step 4: calculate the mass of sulfur trioxide

                                     m=nx M=0.765 x 80.1 =61.2g

                                   THEORETICAL YIELD, ACTUAL YIELD AND PERCENTAGE YIELD
                                   In the laboratory, when you are making a product, you naturally want to obtain as much of it as
                                   possible from the reactants you start with. In industry, where reactions occur on a much larger scale,
                                   and there is economic competition between manufacturers, it is even more important to maximise
                                   the product of a reaction.
                                   There are some reasons why the mass of a reaction product may be less than the maximum possible.
                                   ¢     The reaction is reversible and so may not be complete.
                                   ¢     There are side-reactions that lead to other products that are not wanted.
                                   ¢     The product may need to be purified, which may result in loss of product.

                                   TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO ‘YIELD’
                                   We normally use the term ‘yield’ with other words, such as:
                                   ¢     theoretical yield

                                   *     percentage yield.
                                   In the laboratory, theoretical yield and actual yield may be measured in grams, but in industry,

                                   with from previous topics. It is always assumed that the reaction goes to completion, with no losses.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Calculate percentage atom economies using chemical equations and experimental results.



                                          BACKGROUND TO ATOM ECONOMY
                                          In Topic 1C.4, we looked at the percentage yield of a reaction. The closer the value is to 100%, the better.
                                          A higher percentage means that less of the starting materials are lost or end up as unwanted products.

                                          Percentage yield is an important factor to take into consideration when assessing the suitability of an
                                          industrial process. However, it is not the only one. Other factors include:
                                          ¢   the availability or scarcity of non-renewable raw materials
                                          ¢   the cost of raw materials
                                          ¢   the quantity of energy needed.


                                          HOW ATOM ECONOMY WORKS
                                          Here is an example of atom economy in action.

                                          There are two main processes in the manufacture of phosphoric acid. To make the comparison
                                          easier to follow, a single summary equation is shown for each process.

                                                 Process 1   Ca,(PO,). + 3H,SO, — 2H3PO, + 3CaSO,

                                                 Process 2   P,+5O, + 6H,O — 4H,PO,

                                          There are advantages and disadvantages of both processes. However, what you can see from these
                                          equations is that all of the atoms in the starting materials for Process 2 end up in the desired product.
                                          In Process 1, many of the atoms end up in a second, unwanted product, calcium sulfate. Process 1
                                          has a lower atom economy than Process 2.


                                          THE CONTRIBUTION OF BARRY TROST
                                          A chemist from the USA, Barry Trost, developed the idea of atom economy as an alternative way of
                                          assessing chemical reactions, especially in industrial processes. He believed that it was important to
                                          consider how many atoms from the reactants end up in the desired product.

                                          The expression we use to calculate atom economy (usually described as percentage atom economy) is:
                                                                      molar mass of the desired product
                                                atom economy =                                                  x 100
                                                                   sum of the molar masses of all products

                                          You can see that you do not need a calculator to work out the atom economy of Process 2. There is
                                          only one product, so it must be 100%.
                                                                                  (98.0 x 2) x 100
                                                For Process 1, atom economy = (98.0 x 2) + (136.2         3) = 32.4%


                                          So, you can see that less than one-third of the mass of the starting materials ends up in the desired
                                          product, which does not look good if the CaSO, is a waste product that has to be disposed of. If the
                                          other product has a use, then the manufacturer can sell it, which would partly balance the low atom

                                          REACTION TYPES AND ATOM ECONOMY
                                          We can make some generalisations about certain types of reaction.
                                          ¢   Addition reactions have 100% atom economy.
                                          ¢   Elimination and substitution reactions have lower atom economies.
                                          ¢   Multistep reactions may have even lower atom economies.

WORKED EXAMPLE 3
A manufacturer of ethene wants to convert some ethene into 1,2-dichloroethane. He considers two
possible reactions:



      Reaction 2      2H ,C=CH, + 4HCI + O, — 2CICH,CH,Cl + 2H,O

Explain, without doing a calculation, which reaction would be a good choice on the basis of
atom economy.

The answer is Reaction 1, because there is only one product, so all the atoms in the reactants end up in
the desired product and the atom economy is 100%.

Reaction 2 has a lower atom economy because some of the atoms in the reactants form water, which has
no value as a product.

¢     The relative molecular mass of carbon dioxide is 44.0 but,
      because the relative atomic mass of carbon is 12.0, the

                                  INTRODUCTION TO MOLECULAR FORMULAE
                                  In Topic 1D.1, you learned how to calculate empirical formulae. Sometimes the empirical formula
                                 of a compound is the same as its molecular formula. Carbon dioxide (CO) and water (H,O) are
                                 common examples you will know. The molecular formula of a compound shows the actual
                                 numbers of the atoms of each element in the compound.

                                 Examples of compounds with different empirical and molecular formulae are:

                                               hydrogen peroxide                  empirical formula is HO          molecular formula is H,O,;

                                                    butane                    empirical formula is C,H;            molecular formula is C,H)

                                 To determine the molecular formula of a compound, you need to already know or to calculate:
                                  ¢     the empirical formula
                                  ¢     the relative formula mass.

                                  For example, if you had already found that the empirical formula of a compound was HO and you
                                 then found that its relative formula mass was 34, you could compare the relative mass of the empirical
                                 formula (17) with 34 and work out that the molecular formula was double the empirical formula.


                                 CALCULATING MOLECULAR FORMULAE
                                 You have already practised calculating an empirical formula from experimental data. Now look at
                                 how to calculate a molecular formula from an empirical formula.


                                      WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                                      In this example, the empirical formula is given.
                                      A compound has the empirical formula CH and a relative formula mass of 104.
                                      The ‘formula mass’ of the empirical formula is 13.0.

                                      104 + 13.0 = 8, so the molecular formula of the compound is CgHsg.


                                      WORKED EXAMPLE 2
                                      In this example, you first have to work out the empirical formula. A compound contains the percentage
                                      composition by mass Na = 34.3%, C = 17.9%, O = 47.8%, and has a molar mass of 134g mol".
                                      The calculations are shown below.

                                      The empirical formula is NaCO,.

                                      The ‘formula mass’ of the empirical formula is 23.0 + 12.0 + (2 x 16.0) = 67.0.
                                      The molar mass, 134, is 2 x 67.0, so the molecular formula of the compound is NajC,0,.

EXAMPLE 6
Ammonium sulfate reacts with sodium hydroxide solution to form sodium sulfate, water and
ammonia, as shown in the equation:

      (NH,),SO,(s) + 2NaOQH(aq) — Na,SO,(aq) + 2H,O(1) + 2NH;(g)

What volume of ammonia is formed by reacting 2.16 g of ammonium sulfate with excess sodium
hydroxide solution?

You are not given any information about the sodium hydroxide, and you are not asked anything
about sodium sulfate or water. You can use the mole expression to calculate the amount of
ammonium sulfate:
                        2.16
      n((NH,).SO,) = 3217 0.01635 mol

You can see that the (NH,),SO,: NH; ratio in the equation is 1:2, which means that
0.01635 x 2 = 0.0327 mol of ammonia is formed.

Convert this amount to a volume and you have the answer:

      volume = 24000 x 0.0327 = 785 cm?

An excess of magnesium is added to 100cm? of 1.50 moldm-? hydrochloric acid. The equation for the
reaction is:



What mass of hydrogen is formed?

Step 1: You are given the values of V and c, so you can use the second expression to calculate the value of
n for hydrochloric acid.

       n=0.100 x 1.50 = 0.150mol

Step 2: The ratio for HCI :H, is 2:1, so n(H;) = 0.150 = 2 = 0.0750 mol

Step 3: For hydrogen, m =n x M = 0.0750 x 2.0 =0.15¢

 DID YOU KNOW?
 In April 1940 during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, the Hungarian-born chemist George de Hevesy decided to hide the Nobel Prize medals
 of colleagues Max von Laue and James Franck by dissolving them in aqua regia (a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acid).
 The resulting solution sat on a shelf for the next 5 years attracting no particular attention. At the end of the war, the gold was recovered
 from the solution and the two medals recast.

               ATOMIC STRUCTURE
        AND THE PERIODIC TABLE

        Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that can be made to matter. Matter is anything that has mass
        and takes up space. This includes all solids, liquids and gases. The ancient Greeks thought that all matter was
        made from four elements: Air, Earth, Fire and Water. This idea was gradually abandoned as scientists began to
        experiment and apply logical scientific thinking to their observations.

        In 1803, John Dalton presented his atomic theory. He developed this theory from the idea that the atoms of
        different elements could be distinguished by differences in their weights. Some people still consider that there
        is truth in some parts of his theory. However, scientists have gradually refined the theory into one that more
        precisely explains the observations we can make today. Science works by scientists continuing to experiment
        and make new observations. If scientists cannot explain those observations satisfactorily using the existing
_       theory, then they have to change, or even possibly replace, the theory.
        Atoms, and the particles they are made from, govern how everything works in the world around us. The
        continuing study and understanding of atoms has allowed us to progress with developing: new medicines to
        treat illnesses; the materials and sophisticated technology we use in communications and computing; and
        newer and better materials.
in      In fact, there is probably not a single area of modern life that is not affected by the study
        of atoms.

                              WHO DISCOVERED ELECTRONS, PROTONS AND NEUTRONS?
                              Our current understanding of the structure of atoms is influenced by the theories put forward by
                              scientists such as J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford and James Chadwick.

                              J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897. Ernest Rutherford discovered the proton in 1917.
                              James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932.


                              STRUCTURE OF AN ATOM
                              Although scientists have discovered many other subatomic particles, chemistry is only concerned
                              with electrons, protons and neutrons.

                              We can summarise the structure of the atom in terms of these three subatomic particles, as shown
                              in table A.

                                  A The structure of the atom in terms of protons, neutrons and electrons.

                                Rutherford discovered the proton and he is also credited for first suggesting that the atom has a very
                              small core containing the bulk of the mass of the atom. This core is called the nucleus and contains
                              all of the protons and neutrons in that atom.

                                Electrons are also present in atoms. The electrons exist in energy levels surrounding the nuclei.
                              The energy levels are called quantum shells. We will develop this concept throughout Topic 2A.

                                 LEARNING TIP
                                Never state that the mass of an electron is zero. This is not true, an electron does have a mass.
                                You do not need to know the exact masses of subatomic particles in grams, or the exact charges in coulombs.
                                You need to know the relative values.



                                 DID YOU KNOW?
                                 All atoms of any element have the same atomic number, which is different from the atomic number
                                 of any other element.
                                 The number of electrons in a neutral atom of an element is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus
                                 of that atom.

                                   You can then determine the relative molecular mass (M,) of chlorine by calculating the weighted

                                   If we use this method, the relative molecular mass of chlorine is 2 x 35.5 = 71.
However, you may occasionally

value, such as 24.305.             It is quite difficult to use the data supplied by a mass spectrum of a compound to determine its exact
                                   relative molecular mass. You need to know the exact relative isotopic masses of all the atoms present,
                                   and the relative composition of all the different molecules.
                                   You are more likely to be asked to work out the relative molecular mass of a compound by
                                   considering what is called the molecular ion peak.
                                   You should be careful when analysing organic compounds. This is because there is always a small
                                   percentage of the carbon-13 isotope present in the compound, which can lead to what is referred to
                                   as an M+1 peak. This peak can often be seen in molecules with large masses, where the percentage of
                                   carbon-13 becomes significant. The peak is often missing, or insignificant, in molecules of small mass.
                                   The following examples illustrate this point.

¢    The third quantum shell is divided into three sub-shells,
     labelled 3s, 3p and 3d. Electrons in the 3p sub-shell have

     shell have slightly higher energy than those in 3p.
¢    The fourth quantum shell is divided into four sub-shells,
     labelled 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f. Again, the electron energies increase
     in the order 4s < 4p < 4d < 4f.


s ORBITALS
Each sub-shell contains orbitals. If you could see a single
electron in a hydrogen atom and map its position at regular                A    figB   The shape of typical 1s and 2s orbitals.

p ORBITALS
The 2p sub-shell contains three separate p orbitals. These orbitals are more complex and harder to
visualise. They have an elongated dumbbell shape and a variable charge density. The only difference
between the three orbitals is their orientation in space, as shownin        fig C.
Again, the size and shape of the orbitals means that there is a 90% probability of finding the electron
within their boundaries. The three orbitals are arranged at mutual right angles.

d ORBITALS
The d orbitals are very complicated. You do not need to know their shapes for IAS or IAL studies.
There are five d orbitals in the d sub-shell.

                            As you can see, in general the lowest energy orbitals are occupied and filled first.
                            For example, the electronic configuration of helium (He) is 1s* not 1s'2s’. This is because the 1s
                            orbital can accommodate two electrons, and electrons in the 1s orbital have a lower energy than
                            those in the 2s orbital.

   LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 TM Be able to define first, second, and third ionisation energies and understand that all ionisation energies are endothermic.

 TM Understand how ionisation energies are influenced by the number of protons in the nucleus, the electron shielding and the
        sub-shell from which the electron is removed.

 ® Know that ideas about electronic configurations developed from an understanding that: successive ionisation energies provide
        evidence for the existence of quantum shells and the group to which the element belongs; the first ionisation energy of
        successive elements provides evidence for electron sub-shells.
 TM@    Be able to represent ionisation energy data in graphical form.

 @      Explain the general increase in first ionisation energy across a period.

 @      Explain the decrease in first ionisation energy down a group.

                                HELIUM AND LITHIUM
                                Now consider helium (He) and lithium (Li).

                                The electronic configuration of each is:

                                He         1s?
                                Li         1s?2s!
                                The nuclear charge of lithium is +3 (three protons), which is larger than the nuclear charge of
                                helium (+2).

                                However, the outer electron of lithium is in the second quantum shell in a 2s orbital. The second
                                quantum shell is at a higher energy level than the first quantum shell. Added to this, the electron in

                                the nuclear charge.

                                The last two effects are more significant than the increased nuclear charge. This means that the
                                first ionisation energy of lithium (519 kJ mol") is smaller than the first ionisation energy of helium
                                (2370 kJ mol’).

                                SUMMARY
                                The factors that affect the energy of an electron are:

                                ¢    the orbital in which the electron exists
                                ¢    the nuclear charge of the atom (i.e. the number of protons in the nucleus)
                                ¢    the repulsion (shielding) experienced by the electron from all the other electrons present.


                                TRENDS IN IONISATION ENERGIES
                                The two major trends in ionisation energies in the Periodic Table are found:
                                *    across a period
                                ¢    down a group.


                                ACROSS A PERIOD
                                To illustrate this trend, consider Period 2; and the elements lithium (Li) to neon (Ne).

                                As we move from Li to Ne across Period 2, the nuclear charge increases as the number of protons
                                increases. This, on its own, would lead to an increased attraction between the nucleus and the
                                electron, and therefore a decrease in the energy of the outermost electron, and an increase in first
                                ionisation energy.

                                But, counteracting this, one more electron is added to the same quantum shell on each occasion

                                and this increases the electron—electron repulsion within the quantum shell. This, on its own,

                                elements, scandium (Sc) to zinc (Zn).

                                DOWN A GROUP
                                To illustrate this trend, consider the Group 1 elements, lithium (Li) to caesium (Cs).

                                As we descend through Group 1 from Li to Cs, the nuclear charge increases as the number of
                                protons increases. This would lead to an increased attraction between the nucleus and the electron,
                                and therefore a decrease in energy of the outer electron. This, in turn, would lead to an increase in
                                the first ionisation energy.

                                However, one new quantum shell is added on each occasion. This increases the energy of the
                                outermost electron for two reasons. Firstly, the third quantum shell has a higher energy value than the
                                second; the fourth quantum shell is higher in energy than the third.

                                This continues down the group. Secondly, as each new quantum shell is added, the outer electron
                                experiences increased repulsion (i.e. increased shielding) from the inner electrons.
    TOPIC 2                                                                     2A.4 IONISATION ENERGIES            09

On this occasion, the combined effect of adding an extra shell and increasing the shielding is more
significant than the increase in nuclear charge. So the first ionisation energy decreases down Group 1
from Li to Cs.

This trend is repeated in:
¢     Group 2: beryllium to barium (Be to Ba)
¢     Group 5: nitrogen to bismuth (N to Bi)
¢     Group 6: oxygen to polonium (O to Po)
¢     Group 7: fluorine to astatine (F to At)
¢     Group 8: neon to radon (Ne to Rn).

In Group 4, lead (Pb) is an anomaly (does not fit in with the others) because it has a first ionisation
energy that is higher than that of tin (Sn), the element immediately above it.

There is no general trend in first ionisation energy in Group 3 (boron (B) to thallium (T])).

The explanations for the anomalies in Groups 3 and 4 are not included in this book, but they illustrate
that, in chemistry, you can rarely apply a simple pattern or trend to all situations.

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 Be able to explain:

 M@ the trends in melting and boiling temperatures of the elements of Periods 2 and 3 of the Periodic Table in terms of the
      structure of the element and the bonding between its atoms or molecules;
 MTM the specific trends in ionisation energy of the elements across Periods 2 and 3 of the Periodic Table.



WHAT ARE PERIODIC PROPERTIES?
The elements in a period exhibit periodic properties (also sometimes called periodicity).

We can illustrate the idea of periodic properties by looking at the elements in Periods 2 and 3. We
have already seen one example of periodic properties in Periods 2 and 3 — the regular repeating
pattern of electronic configurations from ns! through to ns’np°. Other examples are the trends in
atomic radii, melting and boiling temperatures, and first ionisation energies.


ATOMIC RADII
The atomic radius of an element is a measurement of the size of its atoms. It is the distance from
the centre of the nucleus to the boundary of the electron cloud. Since the atom does not have
a well-defined boundary, we can find the atomic radius by determining the distance between the
two nuclei and dividing it by two.

                           A   figB     Trend in covalent radii across the second and third periods.

                           You can see that the radius decreases across each period. This is because as the number of
                           protons in the nucleus increases, so does the nuclear charge. This results in an increase in the
                           attractive force between the nucleus and the outer electrons. This increase in attractive force offsets
                           (counterbalances) the increase in electron—electron repulsion as the number of electrons in the outer
                           quantum shell increases.

                             If you are asked to explain trends in melting points, you do not need to be able to remember specific
                             melting points of elements. You only need to be able to explain the trends in terms of bond type.

                           You may have noticed that the elements with giant lattice structures have high melting and boiling
                           temperatures, and those with simple molecular structures have low melting and boiling temperatures.
                           We will explain the reason for this in Topic 3.

STRUCTURE

MOLECULES | D METALLIC BONDING | E SOLID LATTICES
Now that we know something of the structure of atoms, in particular their electronic configurations, we can
look at how atoms combine. Knowing about the way substances are bonded, and the effect that the bonding
and structure has on chemical and physical properties, is essential to the development of new materials. These
new materials are then used to refine and improve products. Computers and mobile phones are smaller,
lighter and faster than ever before. New and better materials for clothes and shoes, particularly for use
outdoors in bad weather conditions, are constantly being developed. Polymers and composites have almost
completely taken the place of more traditional materials such as wood and metal for many uses.

Knowledge of the shapes of molecules is of fundamental importance in understanding how medicines work
and for the future design of new medicines. Knowing the shapes of enzymes is important in the development
of biochemical catalysts for chemical reactions. The shapes of macromolecules such as DNA and proteins are
extremely complicated. However, the rules that govern their shapes are the same as the rules used to predict
the shapes of simple molecules such as methane, water and ammonia.

FORMATION OF SODIUM AND CHLORIDE IONS
For example, sodium chloride can be formed by burning sodium
in chlorine:

      2Na(s) + Cl,(g) — 2NaCl(s)

We can represent the reaction that occurs by two ionic half-equations:

      2Na — 2Na* + 2e° and Cl, + 2e° — 2CIl-

Each sodium atom has lost one electron to become a positive
sodium ion. The chlorine molecule has gained two electrons to
become two chloride ions.

We can represent the electronic changes involved by dot-and-
cross diagrams.

table A Energy required to break up a lattice of an ionic compound.

For ions of the same charge, the smaller the ions the more energy is required to overcome the
electrostatic interactions between the ions and to separate them.
The size of the ions is one factor that affects the strength of ionic bonding, which in turn determines
how closely packed the ions are in the lattice.
The lattice energy for lithium fluoride, Li*F~, is 1031kJ mol‘. The equivalent energy for magnesium
fluoride, Mg?*(F-),, is 2957kJmolTM'. The radius of the Mg** ion (0.072 nm) is very similar to the
radius of the Li* ion (0.074nm). The increased charge of the Mg** ion compared to the Li* ion
results in a significant increase in the strength of the ionic bonding.
When both cation and anion are doubly charged, the energy required to separate the ions is even
larger. For magnesium oxide, Mg’*O*~, the value is 3791 kJ mol“.
There is no simple mathematical relationship to describe the effects that ionic radius and ionic
charge have on the strength of ionic bonding. The situation is complicated by the way in which the
ions pack together to form the lattice, and by the extent to which there are covalent interactions
between the ions. In general, however, the smaller the ions and the larger the charge on the ions, the
stronger the ionic bonding.


EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF IONS
Ionic compounds can conduct electricity and undergo electrolysis when either molten or in aqueous
solution. This is the most convincing evidence for the existence of ions.
For example, when you pass a direct electric current through molten sodium chloride (fig D), sodium
is formed at the negative electrode and chlorine is formed at the positive electrode.

 lTM@ Understand reasons for the trends in ionic radii down a group in the Periodic Table, and for a set of isoelectronic
       ions, e.g. N?~ to Al?*.

TRENDS IN IONIC RADII
Ionic radii are difficult to measure accurately, and vary according to the environment of the ion. For
example, it is important how many oppositely charged ions are touching it (i.e. the co-ordination
number). The nature of the ions is also important.

There are several different ways of measuring ionic radii and they all produce slightly different
values. If you are going to make reliable comparisons using ionic radii, all the values must come
from the same source.

Remember that there are quite large uncertainties when using ionic radii. Trying to explain things in
detail is made difficult because of those uncertainties.

                                         Polarisation will be increased by:
                                         ¢     high charge and small size of the cation (i.e. high charge density of the cation)

                                         HIGH CHARGE AND SMALL SIZE OF CATIONS
                                         The ability of a cation to attract electrons from the anion towards itself is called its polarising
                                         power. A cation with a high charge and a small radius has a large polarising power. An approximate
                                         value for the polarising power of a cation can be obtained by calculating its charge density. The
                                         charge density of a cation is the charge divided by the surface area of the ion. If the ion is assumed

                                         The ease with which an anion is polarised depends on its charge and its size. Anions with a large

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Know that a covalent bond is formed by the overlap of two atomic orbitals each containing a single electron.
M@ Know that a covalent bond is the strong electrostatic attraction between the nuclei of two atoms and the bonding
    (shared) pair of electrons.
M@ Understand the relationship between bond length and bond strength for covalent bonds.


                                  FORMATION OF COVALENT BONDS
                                  A covalent bond forms between two atoms when an atomic orbital containing a single electron from
                                  one atom overlaps with an atomic orbital, which also contains a single electron, of another atom.
                                  The two electrons in the area of overlap are the bonding electrons. They are sometimes referred
                                  to as a ‘shared pair of electrons’. The covalent bond is the electrostatic attraction between the two
                                  nuclei of the bonded atoms and the pair of electrons shared between them.

                                  The atomic orbitals involved can be any of those found in the atoms, but we shall limit our discussion
                                  to those involving only s- and p-orbitals.

                                  Fig A shows three ways in which these orbitals may overlap.

EXAMPLE 3. m BOND FORMATION
Once ao bond has been formed, it is possible, in certain circumstances, for a 7 bond to form.

The 7 bond results in a high electron density both above and below the molecule, as shown in fig E.

A   figE       Formation of ax bond.

This is what happens in the ethene molecule. One of the bonds between the carbon atoms is a
o bond; the other is a 7 bond.

The 7 bond in ethene is weaker than the o bond. This is the reason for the increased reactivity
of alkenes compared with alkanes, and why alkenes can easily undergo addition reactions. (See

                                     BOND LENGTH AND BOND STRENGTH
                                     The bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two atoms that are covalently bonded
                                     together.

                                     The strength of a covalent bond is measured in terms of the amount of energy required to break one
                                     mole of the bond in the gaseous state (see Topic 6).

                                     Table A shows the relationship between the bond length and bond strength of a selection of
                                     covalent bonds.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Know that electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons.
M@ Know that ionic and covalent bonding are the extremes of a continuum of bonding type and that electronegativity
   differences lead to bond polarity.
TM Understand what a polar covalent bond is.
lM Understand that electron density maps for discrete (simple) molecules show that there is a high electron density
   between the nuclei of two covalently bonded atoms.


                               WHAT IS ELECTRONEGATIVITY?
                               Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons.

                               The electronegativity of elements, in general:
                               ¢    decreases down a group of the Periodic Table, that is, from top to bottom
                               *    increases from left to right across a period.

                               This is demonstrated in the following section of the Periodic Table (fig A).

                               DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRON DENSITY
                               If two atoms of the same element are bonded together by the overlap of atomic orbitals, the
                               distribution of electron density between the two nuclei will be symmetrical. This is because the
                               ability of each atom to attract the bonding pair of electrons is identical.

                               The diagram in fig B is an electron density map for chlorine (C1,):

                               The diagram looks like a contour map. The contour lines correspond to electron density. You can
                               think of them as showing how likely it is that a bonding electron will fall within that contour at a given
                               instant in time. For a normal covalent bond, the contours are symmetrical around the nuclei.

                                    However, if the two atoms bonded together are from elements that have different electronegativities,
                                    then the distribution of electron density will not be symmetrical about the two nuclei. This is shown
                                    in fig C by the electron density map for the hydrogen chloride (HCI) molecule.

                                    The contour lines are more closely spaced near to the chlorine atom, which is the atom with the
                                    higher electronegativity.

LEARNING TIP                        Since the electron density is higher around the chlorine atom, that end of the molecule has acquired
                                    a slightly negative charge. This is represented by the symbol 6-. The other end of the molecule

                                    CONTINUUM OF BONDING TYPE
                                    Polar covalent bonds can be thought of as being between two ideals of bonding types. These ideals are:
                                    ¢    pure (100%) covalent
                                    ¢    pure (100%) ionic.

                                    Consider a polar covalent bond as a covalent bond that has some degree of ionic character.

                                    If the electronegativity difference is large enough, then the main type of bonding is ionic.

                                    A very approximate measure of the degree of ionic bonding in a compound is given in table A.

THE OCTET RULE
You might read that in order to form a stable compound, the outer shell of each atom must have the
same number of electrons as the outer shell of a noble gas. In most cases this will be eight electrons.
This has led to a rule that is often referred to as the ‘octet rule’.

This is not always true, as you can see from the examples in table B. In each case, the outer shell of
the central atom of the molecule does not contain eight electrons.

                              DATIVE COVALENT BOND FORMATION
                             A dative covalent bond is formed when an empty orbital of one atom overlaps with an orbital
                             containing a non-bonding pair (lone pair) of electrons of another atom.

                             The bond is often represented by an arrow from the atom providing the pair of electrons, to the atom
                             with the empty orbital. Below are three examples of dative covalent bonds.

Two AICI, molecules bond together. One of the atomic orbitals of a chlorine atom of one AICI,
molecule that contains a lone pair overlaps with the empty orbital of the aluminium atom of a
second AICI, molecule. The same happens between the chlorine atom of the second molecule and
the aluminium atom of the first molecule.

One chlorine atom from each molecule acts as a bridge connecting the two molecules with dative
covalent bonds.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

TM@ Understand that metals consist of giant lattices of metal ions (cations) in a sea of delocalised electrons.
®@ Know that metallic bonding is the strong electrostatic attraction between cations and the delocalised electrons.
M@ Be able to use the above two models to interpret simple properties of metals, e.g. electrical conductivity and high
    melting temperature.


                                  THE NATURE OF METALLIC BONDING
                                  Metals typically have the following physical properties:
                                  ¢   high melting temperatures
                                  ¢   good electrical conductivity
                                  ¢   good thermal conductivity
                                  ¢   malleability
                                  ¢   ductility.

                                  Any theory of the way that the atoms in a metal are bonded together must explain the above
                                  properties.

                                  Metals typically have one, two or three electrons in the outer shell of their atoms and have low
                                  ionisation energies. The electrical conductivity of a metal generally increases as the number of
                                  outer-shell electrons increases.

                                  Since electrical conductivity depends on the presence of mobile carriers of electric charge, we can
                                  build a picture of a metal as consisting of an array of atoms with at least some of their outer-shell
                                  electrons removed and free to move throughout the structure. These delocalised electrons are
                                  largely responsible for the characteristic properties of metals.

                                  The electrons are said to be delocalised since they are free to move throughout the structure and are
                                  not confined, i.e. localised, between any pair of cations.

                                  There are electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and the delocalised electrons. This is
                                  known as metallic bonding.

                                  cations and the delocalised electrons to such an extent that the cations are free to move around the
                                  structure. Metals have a giant lattice structure where many of these forces must be overcome. The
                                  energy required to do this is usually very large, so the melting temperatures are typically high.

The number of delocalised electrons per cation plays a part in determining the melting temperature
of a metal.
¢     Group 1 metals have low melting temperatures.
¢     Group 2 metals have higher melting temperatures.
¢     Metals in the d-block typically have high melting temperatures because they have more
      delocalised electrons per cation.

Another factor that affects the melting temperature is the charge-to-radius ratio of the cation. The
                                                                                                                 DID YOU KNOW?

Metals can be hammered or pressed into different shapes (malleability). They can also be drawn into
a wire (ductility). Both of these properties depend on the ability of the delocalised electrons and the
cations to move throughout the structure of the metal.

Whena stress is applied to a metal, the layers of cations may slide over one another (fig B).

                                                                            layers of cations slide and

However, because the delocalised electrons are free moving, they move with the cations and prevent
strong forces of repulsion forming between the cations in one layer and the cations in another layer.

 only relatively weak London forces of attraction between the layers (see Topic 7), this does not account for
 its lubricating properties. Graphite is five times less able to act as a lubricant at high altitude, and eight times
 less in a vacuum. Its lubricating properties are as a result of adsorbed gases on the surface of the carbon
 atoms. Graphite's inability to act as an effective lubricant in a vacuum is the reason why it is not used as a
 lubricant in spacecraft. Either molybdenum disulfide (MoS,) or hexagonal boron nitride (BN) can be used
 instead.

Graphite is a fairly good conductor of electricity. The delocalised electrons between the layers are
free to flow under the influence of an applied potential difference. An interesting feature of graphite
is that it can only conduct electricity parallel to its layers. The delocalised electrons are not free to
move from one layer to the next. Compare this with a metal, which is able to conduct electricity in all
directions throughout the structure.

Graphite has a high melting temperature for the same reason as diamond.


GRAPHENE
Graphene is pure carbon in the form of a very thin sheet, one atom thick (fig C). The carbon atoms
are bonded in exactly the same way as in graphite and it can, therefore, be described as a one-atom
thick layer of graphite.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MOLECULAR SOLIDS
Molecular solids will, in general, have low melting and boiling temperatures. In order to melt
a molecular solid, it is not necessary to break the covalent bonds within the molecule (the
intramolecular bonds); it is only necessary to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction.

Since intermolecular forces of attraction tend to be much weaker than covalent bonds, little energy is
required to either break down the lattice structure of the solid and cause it to melt, or to separate the
molecules and cause the liquid to boil and vaporise.

Intermolecular forces tend to increase with both an increase in the number of electrons per molecule
and also with increasing length of molecule. This means that a macromolecular solid such as
poly(ethene) will have a much higher melting temperature than its monomer, ethene.

1.    Imagine you are writing an article for an organic farming magazine. How could you re-write this
      story to emphasise the environmental issues without changing the factual content of the article?




CHEMISTRY IN DETAIL
2. (a) Write down the chemical formula of ammonium nitrate and calculate the percentage by mass
         of nitrogen in the compound.
      (b) Ammonium nitrate is an ionic compound. Describe a test that you could carry out in the lab
         to show this and state the expected results.

      (c) Describe the bonding in the NHj ion and explain its shape.
3. Ammonium nitrate decomposes on heating to produce nitrogen, oxygen and water.

      (a) Write a balanced chemical equation for this decomposition.
      (b) Using your answer to part (a), calculate the volume of oxygen (measured at r.t.p) that
         would be produced if one tonne of ammonium nitrate decomposed. (Assume 1 mole of
         any gas occupies 24 dm3 at r.t.p.)
      (c) Using information from the article and your answers to the questions above suggest
         which two hazard symbols you would expect to find on a container of ammonium
         nitrate. Explain your choices.

       INTRODUCTORY
ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND
ALKANES

Organic chemistry is one of the traditional branches of chemistry, like physical and inorganic chemistry.
Students of biology will understand its importance because most types of compounds in this topic are found
in, or are formed in, plants and animals, including the human body. Many aspects of our lives have been
revolutionised by the production of new organic compounds, for example:

*   new polymers with special properties

»   more effective drugs to treat diseases

» the ongoing search for new antibiotics

* sustainable fuels to replace fossil fuels.

Fertilisers and pesticides have increased crop yields to feed the world’s growing population, but this is an
example of where the application of the knowledge of chemistry has caused unexpected problems. Some
people prefer food grown naturally, without the use of human-made chemicals — ironically these foods are
often described as ‘organic’.

In this topic, you will learn about the basics of organic chemistry, for example

» homologous series (compounds that are very similar to each other)

* nomenclature (a systematic way of naming organic compounds)

» isomerism (two or more compounds that have the same molecular formula but are not the same)

You will then look at simple hydrocarbons called alkanes, including their uses as fuels.

                                       EARLY DAYS
                                       Since the 1800s, our knowledge and understanding of chemistry has grown rapidly. To make sense
                                       of all this knowledge, chemists divided chemistry into three main categories: inorganic, organic and
                                       physical chemistry. Each category is equally important. There are millions of different compounds in
                                       existence, and the vast majority are organic compounds. Now, what is organic chemistry?

                                       Today, the word ‘organic’ has a very different meaning in everyday life, and it is often applied to
                                       farming and food. Going back to the 1800s, people believed that there was something special about
                                       some substances. They were only made in plants or animals. One example is the compound called
                                       urea, which is present in human urine. People used to believe that it could only be produced in the
                                       human body. In 1828, the German chemist Friedrich Wohler discovered that urea could be made by
                                       heating a compound (ammonium cyanate) that was not organic. This meant that the idea of organic
                                       compounds only coming from living things was no longer correct.

   from inorganic compounds.           If an organic compound contains other elements as well as carbon and hydrogen, then it is not a
                                       hydrocarbon. For example, many foods contain a sugar called sucrose. Sucrose contains carbon and
                                       hydrogen, but also oxygen, so it is not a hydrocarbon. It is an example of a carbohydrate — the -ate
                                       ending shows that it contains oxygen.


                                        DID YOU KNOW?
                                        In the 1960s, the organic chemist Stephanie Kwolek invented an extremely strong polymer called
                                        Keviar®. Kevlar fibre is now widely used in many applications, including heat resistant gloves,
                                        smartphones, sports equipment and body armour.




                                        A   Award-winning US chemist Stephanie Louise Kwolek was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.

                                     USING DIAGRAMS TO REFER TO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
                                     There are many millions of organic compounds, so making clear which ones we are referring to can
                                     be challenging.

EXAM HINT                            There are two main ways to refer to organic compounds. We can use:
                                     e   formulae

use it. If it asks for a displayed
formula, then a skeletal formula     DISPLAYED FORMULAE
will not gain full marks.
                                     The formulae you saw in Topic 4A.1 are all displayed formulae. They show (display) every
                                     atom and every bond separately. In many situations, these are the best type of formulae to use, but
                                     sometimes it is better to simplify them.

                                     Consider the hydrocarbon with this displayed formula, its name is butane:

                                     STRUCTURAL FORMULAE
                                     One way to simplify this displayed formula is to group all the atoms joined to a particular carbon
                                     atom together. We can choose to show the bonds between the carbons, or we can leave them out.
                                     These are both structural formulae of butane:




                                     SKELETAL FORMULAE
                                     Another way to represent a compound is by a skeletal formula. The word skeletal is connected
                                     with the word skeleton, which, as you know, shows only the bones in a human or animal body.

                                     A skeletal formula is a zig-zag line that shows only the bonds between the carbon atoms. Every
                                     change in direction and every ending means that there is a carbon atom (with as many hydrogen
                                     atoms as needed). Atoms other than carbon and hydrogen need to be shown.

                                     This is the skeletal formula of butane:

                                     gs               ee


                                     The start and end both represent CH;, and the two junctions between lines each represent CH).

                                     MOLECULAR FORMULAE
                                     The displayed, structural and skeletal formulae above show the structures of the molecules
                                     unambiguously. In other words, each formula represents only one compound. With a displayed
                                     formula, this is very clear. With a structural formula, you have to imagine how the atoms are joined
                                     together in groups such as CH, and CHs, but that is very straightforward. With a skeletal formula,
                                     once you know the rules, you can be sure how every atom is arranged in the molecule.

                            FUNCTIONAL GROUP
                            A functional group in a molecule is an atom or group of atoms that gives the compound some
                            distinctive and predictable properties. For example, the functional group of atoms shown as COOH
                            gives substances such as vinegar a sour, acidic taste.

                            There are many organic compounds containing this group. Here are some examples:

                                  HCOOH           CH;COOH           CH;CH,COOH                 CH;CH,CH,COOH


                            HOMOLOGOUS SERIES
                            If you look at the formulae above, you can see that each formula has one more carbon atom and two
                            more hydrogen atoms than the previous one, they differ by CH,. These compounds are the first four
                            members of what is called a homologous series. A homologous series is a set of compounds with
                            the same functional group, similar chemical properties, and physical properties that show a gradation
                            (a gradual change from one to the next).

                            The organic compounds that are mainly used as fuels are the alkanes (you will learn more about
                            alkanes in Topic 4B). Alkanes are not considered to contain a functional group, but otherwise they
                            form a homologous series. The displayed formulae of some alkanes are:

                            GENERAL FORMULAE
                            In Topic 4A.2, we looked at five different types of formulae. Now we are going to look at another
                            type of formula. For the compounds in a homologous series, we can use a general formula to
                            represent all of them. This is done by using the letter n for the number of carbon atoms, excluding
                            any in the functional group. For the compounds with formulae ending in COOH, the general formula
                            is C,H,,,4;COOH.

                            Table A shows the formulae for some of the homologous series in this book.

                            ALKANES
                            We can use the alkanes to illustrate the similarity in chemical properties of a homologous series. For
                            example, when alkanes are burned completely in air, they all form the same two products: carbon
                            dioxide and water.

                                      WHY DO WE NEED RULES FOR NAMING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS?
                                      As the number of known organic compounds has increased, it has become harder to continue to
                                      find new names for them. In Topic 4A.3, we referred to the simplest organic compound (CH,) as
                                      methane, but it was originally known as marsh gas (because it was found in marshes, where it was
                                      formed by the decay of plants). Many other organic compounds were named in similar ways.

                                      An organisation called the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (usually abbreviated
                                      to IUPAC (‘eye-you-pack’)) made some rules about how to name organic compounds. These rules
                                      are known as ‘nomenclature’. The detailed rules needed for naming very complicated compounds
                                      are complex, but the simpler rules for the compounds described in your IAS course are much easier
                                      to understand and apply.


                                      THE SIMPLE RULES OF NOMENCLATURE
                                      Table A summarises the principles of naming organic compounds, including rules for prefixes,
                                      suffixes and locants.

 THE PART OF THE NAME             HOW TO WRITE IT                                                       EXAMPLE

 Number of carbon atoms __| This is shown by using a letter code (usually three or four letters).       meth = one carbon atom
 Prefixes                         The presence of atoms other than carbon and hydrogen is shown         bromo = an atom of bromine
 Suffixes                         by adding other letters before or after the code for the number of    ol = a hydroxyl group (OH)
                                  carbon atoms.

 Multiplying prefixes             The presence of two or more identical groups is shown by using the | di = two
                                  prefixes di-, tri-, etc.

 Locants                          Where atoms and groups can have different positions ina molecule, | 2- = the atom or group is
                                  numbers and hyphens are used to show their positions. The numbers | attached to the second carbon
                                  represent the carbon atoms in the longest chain that the atoms and __| atom in the chain
                                  groups are attached to.

APPLYING THE RULES TO WRITE NAMES
ALKANES
We can see how these rules work for some of the alkanes (table C). The names of all the alkanes end in -ane.

 STRUCTURAL FORMULA                     | NAME

  CH,—     CH;—     CH,                  propane

            |                            The locant 2- is not needed because if the methyl group below the horizontal chain were attached
           CH,                           to one of the carbon atoms at either end of the chain, then there would be a sequence of four
                                         carbon atoms, and the compound would be named butane.
  CH,— 3   CH,— 2   CH — CH,—
                            CH, | 3-methylpentane
                    |                    The longest carbon chain contains five carbon atoms, and there is a methyl group attached to
                    CH,                  the third one.

  CH,—     CH,—     CH,— CH—-CH, | 2-methylpentane
                             |           This is not 4-methylpentane because another rule is that the lowest locant numbers should be used.

           CH,                           2,3-dimethylbutane
            |                            This example shows the use of a comma between the locants when the attached groups are
  CH,—     CH — CH — CH,                 the same.

                    |                    This example illustrates the rule about prefixes being in alphabetical order. Ethyl comes before
 CH;— CH,— CH — CH — CH, | methyl because e comes before m in the alphabet.
                                 |       Notice also that it is not called 3-ethyl-4-methylpentane because these numbers (3 + 4) total more
                                 al      than the numbers 3 + 2 in the correct name.

ALCOHOLS
Next, look at the alcohols in table D. The rules for these are a bit different because the presence of the
alcohol functional group is indicated by a suffix, not a prefix. The names for all the alcohols end in -ol.

 STRUCTURAL FORMULA                     | NAME

  CH,— CH,— OH                           ethanol

 CH,— CH,— CH,— OH                       propan-1-ol
                                         This time, the locant appears near the end of the name, but, as before, it appears directly before the
                                         letters representing the group.

  CH,— CH — CH — CH,                     3-methylbutan-2-ol
                |       |                This example illustrates the use of both a prefix and a suffix. This is not called 2-methylbutan-3-ol
           OH       CH,                  because the lowest number locant should be used for the suffix functional group (-2-ol not -3-ol).
           CH,                           3,3-dimethylbutan-1-ol
                |                        This example shows the use of prefixes, a suffix, locants and a comma. As with alkanes, the name
  CH,—     © — CH,—         CH,— OH | uses locants that add up to the smallest possible number.

TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ISOMERISM                                                A good way to begin is by showing all the carbon atoms

There are two important types of structural isomerism.

Chain isomerism refers to molecules with different carbon chains.            Next see if there is another way to show the carbon atoms, not as

of chain isomers because their carbon chains are different.                  Then add the other atoms in as many different ways as possible.

                         Time for some examples.

                         It is useful to refer to each carbon in a chain as Cl, C2, etc.


                          WORKED EXAMPLE
                          Draw the structural isomers for the molecular formula C,H¢Cl..
                          Step 1 The four carbon atoms can all be in a straight line, or in a straight line of three with a branch from
                                 the middle carbon to the fourth carbon. Let's start with the straight line of four:
                                 CSRS eS
                          Step 2 There are two Cl atoms. They could both be attached to C1 or to C2 in this chain. You might think
                                 that they could be attached to C3 and C4 as well. They could be, but counting from the right, C1 and
                                 C4 are the same, and C2 and C3 are the same.
                                 The two Cl atoms could also be attached to different carbon atoms, such as C1 and C2, or C2 and
                                 C3. It will take a lot of practice before you decide on the correct number of different structures.
                                 You might miss some possible structures, or write two structures that look different but are actually
                                 the same.
                          Step 3 Finally, add the necessary hydrogen atoms, making sure that every carbon atom has four bonds.
                          Table A shows the approach.

You may think there are other possible structures. These others may look different on paper, but
careful checking will show that they have already been used. Here is a useful way to be sure whether
two structures are different, or whether they look different but are actually the same. Apply the
IUPAC rules to name the structures. If this gives you two completely different names, then the
structures are different. If it gives you the same names, then the structures are the same.


ALKANES AND CYCLOALKANES
You need to be able to draw the structures of all the alkanes and cycloalkanes with up to six carbon
atoms. You have already seen structures of some examples of these homologous series, but now let us
adapt the method we used for the structures of C,HgCl,. We can do this for the compounds with five
carbon atoms as examples.

First, the alkanes. With 5 carbon atoms, there are only three different ways to arrange the carbon
atoms. These are: (1) a line of 5; (2) a line of 4 with the 5th carbon branching off one of the central
carbons; and (3) a line of 3 with the 4th and 5th carbons both branching off the middle one. Once
you have realised this, you can just write these three possibilities, making sure that each carbon has
the correct number of hydrogen atoms. Remember that each carbon atom must have 4 bonds, and
the total number of hydrogen atoms must be 12.

                                                                                        CH,


                                                       CH,                      CH, — C— CH,


CH, — CH, — CH, — CH, — CH,                  CH, — CH — CH, — CH,                        CH,


Now for the cycloalkanes. There can be a ring of 5 carbon atoms; or a ring of 4 carbon atoms with
the 5th carbon atom attached to any one of the 4; or a ring of 3 carbon atoms with the 4th and 5th
attached to the same or different carbons in the ring. Remember that each carbon atom must have 4
bonds, and the total number of hydrogen atoms must be 10. These are the possibilities.

 LEARNING TIP
 Try drawing structures for all the possible isomers of the alkanes with six carbon atoms in the molecule. You
 will probably draw more than there really are. You can then decide which ones you don't need by naming
 them. If they look different but have the same name, then they are the same.



 CHECKPOINT
 1. Draw a structure for each of the alkane isomers with the molecular formula C3H,Bry.

 2. Draw a structure for each of the cycloalkane isomers with the molecular formula C3H,Brp.

M@ Know that alkanes are used as fuels and obtained from the fractional distillation, cracking and reforming of crude oil,
     and be able to write equations for these reactions.


                                           THE NEED FOR FUELS
                                           The worldwide demand for energy is huge and steadily rising. At present, most of this energy comes
                                           from burning fossil fuels, in the form of coal, crude oil and natural gas. Most compounds in crude oil
                                           and natural gas are alkanes.

                                           In this topic we will look at the three main processes used to convert crude oil into fuels. They are:

                                           e    fractional distillation

                                           e    cracking

                                           e    reforming.

                                           These processes are used in oil refineries located all over the world. You will already know something
                                           about fractional distillation, but you may be less familiar with cracking and reforming.


                                           FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION
                                           Crude oil is a complex mixture of compounds, mostly hydrocarbons. The composition of the
                                           mixture varies quite a lot depending on which part of the world the crude oil comes from. The
                                           process is sometimes called ‘fractionation’ because it involves converting the crude oil into a small
                                           number of fractions. The number of fractions varies between different refineries but is typically six.
                                           Fractionation is done in a distillation column.

years ago. A wide definition of biofuels would include wood, which
has been used as a fuel for many centuries and is still important in
some countries today.

The terms ‘renewable’ and ‘non-renewable’ are often used when
discussing energy sources. Non-renewable usually refers to coal,
oil and natural gas. Renewable sources include biofuels, but also
sunlight, wind, waves and tides, and geothermal energy.


CARBON NEUTRALITY
Fuels can be considered in terms of their carbon neutrality.
Ideally, a fuel should be completely carbon neutral, although few
are. The closer a fuel is to being carbon neutral, the better.          A   figA     Bioethanol (on the left) is sold next to unleaded petrol and diesel.

It is not easy to prevent these further substitution reactions from
occurring. As well as the formation of chloromethane, these other
reactions occur and other products are formed:

       the formation of dichloromethane
            CH,Cl + Cl, — CH,Cl, + HCl

       the formation of trichloromethane
            CH,Cl, + Cl, -— CHCl, + HCl

       the formation of tetrachloromethane
            CHCl, + Cl, — CCl, + HCl

Each of these overall reactions can be represented by the same
sequence of initiation, propagation and termination steps as for
the formation of chloromethane.

The likelihood of these further reactions occurring means that
this is not a good method for the preparation of chloromethane
or other halogenoalkanes. This is because the yield will be low
because of these further reactions, and also because several
products have to be separated.

In nature, methane is mostly produced by bacteria, for example
in the intestines of cows. Additionally, the simplest alkane is also
produced by bacteria in wetlands, so for a long time it was known
as marsh gas.

     A ALKENES |B ADDITION POLYMERS
     In Topic 4, you learned about the basics of organic chemistry and a homologous series called the alkanes,
     which are mostly used as fuels. In this topic, you will learn about a second homologous series called the
     alkenes. Alkenes can be burned to produce heat energy, but are far too valuable to waste in this way, as they
     have more important uses.

     In particular, alkenes are used to make polymers (often called plastics). These substances have transformed
_4
     the way we use materials. Many objects that used to be made of wood or metal are now made of polymers.
     Some polymers have replaced clothing that used to be made of wool, cotton or silk.

     One disadvantage of polymers is that in some situations they have been viewed as disposable, so many plastic
     shopping bags and drink bottles are intended to be used once only. When they are then thrown away, they
     cause litter or can harm animals and sea life.

     Chemists are working on ways to solve these problems by:

     « developing biodegradable polymers

     * finding ways to convert polymer waste into useful materials such as clothing.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 TM   Know the general formula for alkenes and understand that alkenes and cycloalkenes are hydrocarbons which are unsaturated
      (have a carbon-carbon double bond which consists of a sigma bond and a pi bond).


WHAT ARE ALKENES?                                                        When drawing the structures of alkenes, you normally show the

You have already discovered a lot of information about alkanes,
but so far you have only come across alkenes as examples used to
illustrate nomenclature and isomerism.

The main difference between alkanes and alkenes is that alkanes
contain only single bonds, but alkenes contain at least one C=C
                                                                         Just as some alkanes are cyclic, so are some alkenes.    A common

They may involve the overlapping of two s orbitals, or one s orbital and one p orbital, or two p
orbitals. All of these bonds are represented by a straight line. The covalent bond between the two
hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule can be shown as H—H. All of these types of bond can be
referred to as sigma bonds (o-bonds). When these sigma bonds are formed between carbon atoms
in an alkene, their formation is sometimes described as formation by axial overlap, or end-on overlap.


PI BONDS
Now, consider what happens when the three sigma bonds around each carbon atom are formed in
ethene. After they are formed, each carbon atom has one electron in a p orbital that has not been
used in bond formation. These p orbitals are parallel to each other and are not able to overlap in the
same way as in the formation of sigma bonds. When they do overlap, this results in the formation of
two regions of negative charge above and below the C—C sigma bond. This type of bond is formed
by the sideways overlap of orbitals, and bonds of this type are referred to as pi bonds (z-bonds).
Each of these regions of negative charge contains one electron, so together they make up a second
shared pair of electrons between the two carbon atoms.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

TM   Explain geometric isomerism in terms of restricted rotation around a C=C double bond and the nature of the substituents on
     the carbon atoms.

TM   Understand the E-Z naming system for geometric isomers and why it is necessary to use this when the cis- and trans- naming
     system breaks down.


                                 STEREOISOMERISM
                                 You learned about structural isomerism in Topic 4A.5. Structural isomers are compounds with
                                 the same molecular formula but with different structural formulae. Now we are going to consider
                                 a different type of isomerism called stereoisomerism. This is the overall term for two types of
                                 isomerism that you need to know about. You will recognise the ‘stereo’ part of the word from its use
                                 as a description of headphones. Stereo headphones allow you to hear some sounds through your left
                                 ear and other sounds through your right ear, and stereo is a reference to three dimensions.
                                 One type of stereoisomerism is optical isomerism, which you will meet in Topic 15. The other type
                                 is geometric isomerism, which we will look at in this topic.
                                 All the types of isomerism you will meet in this course are shown in fig A in the form of a family tree.

                                 So what are stereoisomers? Stereoisomers have the same structural formula but differ from each
                                 other because their atoms or groups are arranged differently in three dimensions.

                                 GEOMETRIC ISOMERISM
                                 Geometric isomers differ from each other because their atoms or groups are attached at different
                                 positions on opposite sides of a C=C double bond.
                                 To understand this, start by considering the alkene but-2-ene. Its structural formula can be shown as:
                                 CH,— CH = CH — CH,

                                 The name comes from four carbon atoms in a chain (but-), a carbon-carbon double bond (-ene),
                                 with 2- showing that the double bond comes after the second carbon atom in the chain.

                                 Unfortunately, showing the structure like this (with the atoms in a straight line) does not help us
                                 understand what geometric isomerism is. We need to show the bonds at angles of 120° to each other.
                                 Now you can see that there can be two different arrangements:


                                     a             i                  oN        ye

                                 The left-hand structure shows the two CH; groups further apart from each other. They are across
                                 the molecule. We add the abbreviation trans- (Latin for ‘across’) to the beginning of the name to
                                 indicate this. Think of the word transatlantic, which means at opposite ends of the Atlantic Ocean.
                                 The complete name is trans-but-2-ene.

 TM Describe the reactions of alkenes with hydrogen, halogens, steam, hydrogen halides and potassium manganate(VII).


WHY DO ADDITION REACTIONS OCCUR?
In Topic 5A.1 we learned that the C=C double bond in an alkene
is made up of two different single bonds, a sigma bond and a
pi bond. Because the sigma bond electrons are more tightly held
between the two carbon atoms, a sigma bond is stronger than a
pi bond. This means that a double bond is stronger than a single
bond, but it is not twice as strong.

Most reactions of alkenes involve the double bond becoming
a single bond. In these reactions, the sigma bond remains

    TM Describe the mechanism (including diagrams), giving evidence where possible, of the electrophilic addition of bromine and
        hydrogen bromide to ethene, and the addition of hydrogen bromide to propene.



BACKGROUND
We have already looked at reaction mechanisms with alkanes (initiation, propagation and
termination). We saw howa curly half-arrow was used to represent the movement of a single
electron. Now we can look in some detail at how addition reactions occur, which will involve the use
of (full) curly arrows to represent the movement of a pair of electrons.

We will start with the reaction between ethene and hydrogen bromide, which we looked at in
Topic 5A.3.

You already know that an alkene such as ethene has a pi bond, which is a region of high electron
density (we could say that the molecule is electron rich around the C=C double bond). This makes
an alkene molecule attractive to other species that are electron deficient, including molecules with
polar bonds. Hydrogen bromide is a polar molecule because bromine is more electronegative than
hydrogen, and can be shown with partial charges as:

         6+     6-

         H—Br


WHY DO ELECTROPHILES ATTACK ALKENES?
When a hydrogen bromide molecule approaches an ethene molecule, the slightly positive end of the
HBr molecule is attracted to the electrons in the pi bond in C=C. The HBr molecule is described as
an electrophile when it does this. Remember that electrophiles attack centres of negative charge.

The curly arrows used in reactions of this type must either:
¢    start from a bond and move to an atom, or
¢    start from a lone pair of electrons and move to an atom.


ELECTROPHILIC ADDITION OF HYDROGEN HALIDES
The complete name of this reaction is electrophilic addition. It involves addition and it involves
attack by an electrophile. This is the mechanism of the reaction between ethene and hydrogen
bromide. Notice that the hydrogen bromide molecule breaks so that both electrons in the H—Br
bond go to one atom (in this case, bromine, because it is more electronegative than hydrogen).

This kind of bond breaking is called heterolytic fission (compare this with homolytic fission in the
substitution reactions of alkanes).

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Understand how chemists limit the problems caused by polymer disposal by developing biodegradable polymers and by
   removing toxic waste gases produced by the incineration of polymers.


                               BACKGROUND
                               A hundred years ago, traditional materials used to make everyday objects were substances such as
                               wood, metal, glass, wool and paper. Although these materials are still used today, we have become
                               increasingly reliant on polymers (plastics) for many everyday objects. Reasons for the increasing use
                               of polymers include the following.
                               ¢   They can be manufactured on a large scale in a variety of complex shapes and with a wide range
                                   of physical properties. Think of plastic bottles that can be rigid when used to hold bleach or
                                   flexible to hold washing-up liquid.

                               ¢   They are often lighter in weight than traditional alternatives. Think of milk in a glass bottle
                                   compared to a plastic bottle.
                               ¢   They are unreactive and so they can be used to contain many substances safely for long periods.
                                   Think of how metals corrode and wood rots.

                               Polymers are also relatively cheap to make when they are mass produced and many people see
                               them as disposable. Many years ago, ‘disposable’ meant that after use, the only thing to do was to
                               throw the object away, perhaps in a bin, to be forgotten and taken away by the refuse collection
                               service. Until a few years ago, most polymer waste ended up in landfill, in other words, buried in
                               the ground, but this method of disposal is now used much less. This is partly because of the limited
                               space available in landfill sites, but also because in many countries there are now rules (supported by
                               financial penalties) to decrease the use of landfill. In many countries there is growing awareness of
                               the value of waste such as plastic bottles, and these are separated for recycling.




                                                                             mai     7

                               SOLUTIONS TO POLYMER WASTE
                               There are several ways to limit the problems caused by the disposal of polymer waste.

                               ¢   One way is not to use polymers unnecessarily. In some countries, the use of single-use plastic bags
                                   by supermarkets has been banned.
    TOPIC 5                                                                   5B.2 DEALING WITH POLYMER WASTE

¢     Another way is recycling, which means converting the polymer waste into new materials that are
      useful. For example, poly(ethylene terephthalate), better known as PET or PETE, is widely used in
      plastic bottles, and this polymer is now recycled on a large scale to make carpets.

      Incineration (burning the polymers) is widely used. Although this method gets rid of the polymer
      waste, unfortunately it leads to the formation of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) and also some
      toxic gases.

¢     Biodegradable polymers are considered by many scientists to be worth developing.

INCINERATION
The elements present in polymer waste are mostly hydrogen and carbon, so they can be used as
fuels, in a similar way to other hydrocarbons. An incinerator takes in polymer waste and converts it
into heat energy that can be used to heat homes and factories, or used to generate electricity. There
is very little solid waste left after incineration, but that is because most of the atoms in the polymers
end up in gaseous products which pass into the atmosphere via a chimney.

There is often local opposition when there is a proposal to build an incinerator because of concerns
about air pollution. This is because, as well as hydrogen and carbon, there are other elements in
the polymer waste: PVC which contains chlorine; and small amounts of toxic heavy metals from                          .         —

remove toxic waste gases produced by incineration.                                                                    the chimney?


BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS
Traditional plastics put into landfill do not break down. The idea of using biodegradable polymers
(sometimes described as biopolymers) is to allow them to be broken down by microbes in the
environment. This sounds like a good idea, and some of them are used on a small scale in medicine
(for sutures (stitches) and in drug delivery). However, there are some disadvantages.
¢     They are often made from plant material, so there is the same issue to consider as with biofuels,
      that is, land is needed to grow the plants.
¢     They are designed to break down in the environment, so when they do, the hydrogen and carbon
      atoms they contain cannot be directly used.


    LEARNING TIP
    Try to use the terms ‘disposal’ and ‘incineration’ correctly.
    Disposal just refers to removing or throwing away the polymer without indicating how, while incineration is   -

You will be familiar with many exothermic reactions in everyday life even if you do not always realise it.
Exothermic reactions can be easily identified because the reaction mixture gets hot. The heat energy
generated can then be used for heating. Perhaps the most common example of this is burning natural gas: the
heat energy generated can then be used to cook food.

lf your hands have got very cold while outdoors, you may have used a chemical hand warmer. One type of
chemical hand warmer uses anhydrous calcium oxide (CaO) and water. These are kept in separate
compartments and then mixed by breaking the seal. When the two chemicals mix, an exothermic reaction
takes place and the mixture gets hot.

In contrast, endothermic reactions can often be recognised by the reaction mixture getting cold. They are less
common, but you may be familiar with sherbet, which contains citric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate.
Sherbet is the effervescent powder that children eat as a sweet and which can also be made into a drink.
When you add water to this mixture, an endothermic reaction takes place and the temperature of the mixture
drops, which is why the inside of your mouth feels cold when you eat sherbet.

Interestingly, the chemical reactions that take place when an egg is cooked are also endothermic. Another way
of recognising an endothermic reaction is that it needs a constant supply of energy for the reaction to
continue. If you take the frying pan off the hob, then the egg will stop cooking.

                                   CHEMICAL AND HEAT ENERGY
                                   The first law of thermodynamics states that, during a chemical reaction, energy cannot be created or
                                   destroyed. However, one form of energy can be transferred into another form.

                                   Various forms of energy are interesting to a chemist. Two of the most important ones are:
                                   e     chemical energy
                                   e     heat energy.


                                   CHEMICAL ENERGY
                                   Chemical energy is made up of two components:
                                   e     Kinetic energy, which is a measure of the motion of the particles (atoms, molecules or ions) in a

                                       LEARNING TIP
                                       Do not confuse heat energy with heating. Heating is the result of a transfer of heat energy from one system
                                       to another, which in turn produces a change of temperature.
                                       For example, when water at 60°C is put in contact with air at 20°C, heat energy will be transferred from the
                                       water to the air. This will result in an increase in temperature of the air, with a subsequent decrease in
                                       temperature of the water. This is why a cup of hot coffee gets cold when you forget to drink it.

                                   Two types of process can take place. These are:
                                   e     exothermic — where heat energy is transferred from the system to the surroundings
                                   e     endothermic — where heat energy is transferred from the surroundings to the system.

                                   Examples of exothermic and endothermic processes are given in table A.

STANDARD CONDITIONS
In 1982, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
(IUPAC) recommended that all enthalpy changes should be
quoted using standard conditions of 100kPa pressure and a stated
temperature. The temperature most commonly used is 298 K.

Under these conditions, the enthalpy change measured is called
the ‘standard enthalpy change’, and is given the symbol AA’Sogx or
simply AH®.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

®@ Know that, by convention, exothermic reactions have a negative enthalpy change and that endothermic reactions
   have a positive enthalpy change.
TM@ Be able to construct and interpret enthalpy level diagrams showing an enthalpy change, including appropriate signs
   for exothermic and endothermic reactions.


                              HOW TO DRAW AND INTERPRET ENTHALPY LEVEL DIAGRAMS
                              In an exothermic reaction, the final enthalpy of the system is less than its initial enthalpy. The reverse
                              is true for an endothermic process. This is shown in the two enthalpy level diagrams in fig A.

                                  LEARNING       TIP
                                  You must get two things right in labels for an enthalpy level diagram:
                                  1. The + / — sign of AH must be correct
                                  2. The direction of the arrow for AH must be correct.
                                  The arrow should always point towards the products, as the change is from the reactants to the products.

     ‘Progress of reaction’). It is, however, essential to label the horizontal axis in an enthalpy profile
     diagram (see Topic 9 on reaction kinetics).

    LEARNING TIP
    When the two equations from stages 1 and 3 are used together, they result in the correct sign for AH.
    In this example, AH is negative, which is consistent with the exothermic reaction that is taking place.

    If the temperature had decreased during the reaction, then AT would be negative, which in turn would
    make Q negative. This would lead to a positive value for AH, consistent with an endothermic reaction.

    If in doubt, always use your common sense. If the temperature increases, the reaction must be exothermic,
    and vice versa.


EVALUATING SOURCES OF ERROR AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE EXPERIMENTS
The value obtained from the above experiment is in reasonable agreement with the standard
enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol, as obtained from a data book, of —1367kJ mol". This
means that the errors in procedure were minimal.

Here are some possible sources of error.

¢     Some of the heat energy produced in burning is transferred to the air and not the water.

¢     Some of the ethanol may not burn completely to form carbon dioxide and water. (Incomplete
      combustion would produce less heat energy and also cause soot to form on the bottom of the
      copper can.)

¢    Some of the heat energy produced in burning is transferred to the copper can and not to the
      water.

¢    The conditions are not standard. For example, water vapour, not liquid water, is produced.

¢    The experiment takes a long time. This means that not all of the heat energy transferred from the
      water to the surroundings is compensated for.

table A The standard enthalpy change of neutralisation is remarkably constant
        for certain combinations of acid and alkali.                                Mean starting temperature = 3(18.6 + 18.8) = 18.7°C (291.7 K)
                                                                                Temperature change, AT = (298.5 - 291.7) = +6.7K
All of the acids and alkalis in table A are classified as strong

Because the reaction is essentially the same in each case, it is not
surprising that the enthalpy changes are so similar.                            Amount of acid neutralised = amount of water formed

                                                                                                                     = 1.00moldm-? x 0.025 dm?

EVALUATING SOURCES OF ERROR AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE EXPERIMENTS
Answers should be given to only two significant figures. This is because A7 is given to only two
significant figures.

There are the usual uncertainties of measurements involved with the use of the pipette and the
thermometer. Additionally, some heat energy will be transferred to the thermometer and the
polystyrene cup.

CALCULATING AN ENTHALPY CHANGE OF REACTION USING
MEAN BOND ENTHALPIES
Here is the process for calculating an enthalpy change of reaction using mean bond enthalpies.
¢     Step 1: Calculate the sum of the mean bond enthalpies of the bonds broken, (bonds broken).
¢     Step 2: Calculate the sum of the mean bond enthalpies of the bonds made, /(bonds made).
¢     Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change of reaction using the equation:
                  A,H = &(bonds broken) — ©(bonds made)


    WORKED EXAMPLE 1
    Calculate the enthalpy change of reaction for:

          H,(g) + Cl{g) + 2HCI(g)
given the following data:

          E(H—H) = 436k) mol"
          E(CI—Cl) = 244k) mol!
          E(H—Cl) = 432k) mol"!

Answer

          X{(bonds broken) = (436 + 244) = 680kj mol"!
          &(bonds made) = (432 x 2) = 864k) mol"
          A,H = (680 - 864) = -184k) mol-!



WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Calculate the enthalpy change of reaction for:

          H0,(!) + H2O(I) + 50,(g)
given the following data:
          E(O—H) = 463 kJ mol!
          E(O—O) = 146k} mol"!
          E(O=O) = 496k} mol"!
If you look at the displayed formula for each substance you will see that the two O—H bonds in hydrogen
peroxide, H,O,, are also present in water:
          f—O—O-H and H-O—H

So we do not have to include these in our calculations.

Answer

          X(bonds made) = 4 x 496k) mol"! = 248kj mol"
          A,H = (146 - 248) = -102k) mol"!

                                   REACTION
                                   For this type of calculation, you will be supplied with a value for the enthalpy change of a reaction,
                                   together with all the relevant mean bond enthalpies except one: the one you are asked to calculate.

                                   To solve the problem, simply substitute the known mean bond enthalpies and the unknown bond
                                   enthalpy into the expression:

                                         A.H = X(bonds broken) — &(bonds made)

                                   Rearrange the expression to make the unknown bond enthalpy the subject, and solve the problem.

   The forces of attraction holding molecules together are called intermolecular forces. The energy required to
   separate molecules in liquids and solids is much smaller than the energy required to break covalent bonds.
   However, intermolecular forces still play an important role in determining the properties of a substance, such
   as boiling temperature, miscibility and solubility.                                                                                     Ky

   When a capillary, a narrow tube, touches the surface of a liquid, fluid rises into the tube. The extent to which a     |        re
   liquid rises is different for different liquids. When a narrow glass tube is inserted into water, the water rises in
   the tube. This occurs because the surface of glass is quite polar. As water molecules rise along the inside                     ,
   surface of the capillary, they pull up other water molecules to which they have formed hydrogen bonds. The
   balance of gravity and the attraction of the water for the glass surface determine the height to which the water
   rises. Other polar liquids as well as water also rise in capillaries, but some non-polar liquids show the opposite
   effect, the height of the liquid inside the capillary is less than outside. The molecules of these non-polar liquids
   are attracted to each other more than they are to the surface of the glass. Capillary action is also responsible
  for absorption of liquids into paper, such as paper towels.

   Life on Earth may exist because of the hydrogen bond. The physical properties of water, which covers about
  two thirds of Earth's surface and composes a similar proportion of the human body, are largely due to its
   extensive network of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding and intermolecular forces are the basis of the                                |

A number of interactions between molecules are considerably
weaker than typical covalent and polar covalent bonds. These
interactions are usually described as:

              AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

MM Understand in terms of intermolecular interactions, the physical properties shown by materials, including:
    (i) the trends in boiling temperatures of alkanes with increasing chain length
    (ii) the effect of branching in the carbon chain on the boiling temperatures of alkanes
    (iii) the relatively low volatility (higher boiling temperatures) of alcohols compared with alkanes with a similar number
        of electrons
    (iv) the trends in boiling temperatures of the hydrogen halides HF to HI.

lM Understand the following anomalous properties of water resulting from hydrogen bonding:
    (i) its relatively high melting and boiling temperatures
    (ii) the density of ice compared with that of water.
lM Understand the reasons for the choice of solvents, including:
    (i) water, to dissolve some ionic compounds, in terms of the hydration of the ions
    (ii) water, to dissolve simple alcohols, in terms of hydrogen bonding
    (iii) water, as a poor solvent for some compounds, in terms of inability to form strong hydrogen bonds
    (iv) non-aqueous solvents, for compounds which have similar intermolecular interactions to those in the solvent.

You can see the relationship between chain length and points of contact using the skeletal formulae
of the alkanes (fig B).

Because of their shapes, the molecules of the alkanes fit together very well and pack very closely.
There are points of contact all the way along the chain. The longer the chain, the more points of
contact there are.


BRANCHED ALKANES
Branched chain alkanes have lower boiling temperatures than their unbranched isomers (table A).

table A

The more branching in the molecule, the fewer points of contact between adjacent molecules; i.e. they
do not pack together as well. This leads to a decrease in the overall intermolecular force of attraction
between molecules and a decrease in boiling temperature.


ALCOHOLS
Alcohols are a homologous series of compounds with the general formula C,,H,,,,,;OH (see Topic 10).
They contain an -O—H group and can therefore form intermolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to
London forces. This additional bonding affects the boiling temperature of alcohols when compared
with the equivalent alkane. This is shown in table B.

length. They also have the same number of electrons. If the intermolecular interactions in each
were only London forces, then their boiling points would be almost identical. However, the boiling
point of the alcohol is higher than that of the alkane. This is because of the hydrogen bonding that exists

forces of attraction in water are greater than would be expected from the number of electrons (10)
in the molecule.

Water, therefore, has an abnormally high melting temperature (0 °C, 273 K) and boiling temperature
(100°C, 373K) at 100kPa pressure.

It is interesting to compare the boiling temperatures of water, ammonia and hydrogen fluoride
(table E).

The number of electrons per molecule is identical, so we would expect the London forces to
be similar between each set of molecules. The differences are a result of different extents of
hydrogen bonding.

The hydrogen bond strength for HF is greater than the hydrogen bond strength for H,O, but
surprisingly, its boiling temperature is lower. This is because of two factors.

1    HF forms two hydrogen bonds per molecule, whereas water molecules can form up to four
     hydrogen bonds per molecule. This means that the hydrogen bonding is much more extensive
     in water.

2    Not all of the hydrogen bonds in HF are broken on vaporisation, since HF is substantially
     polymerised, even in the gas phase.

Ammonia has the lowest boiling temperature of the three compounds. The amount of hydrogen
bonding in ammonia is limited by the fact that each nitrogen atom only has one lone pair. In a group
of ammonia molecules, there are not enough lone pairs to go around to satisfy all the hydrogen
atoms. This means that, on average, each ammonia molecule can form one hydrogen bond using its
lone pair and one involving one of its 6+ hydrogen atoms. The other hydrogen atoms are ‘wasted’.
The reason for the relatively low boiling temperature of ammonia is presumably the low strength of
the hydrogen bonding between its molecules.

DENSITY OF ICE
As we mentioned above, water has another unusual property: the density of the solid (ice) is less than
the density of the liquid at 0°C.

The molecules in ice are arranged in rings of six, held together by hydrogen bonds (fig D).

                                The structure creates large areas of open space inside the rings. When ice melts, the ring structure is
                                destroyed and the average distance between the molecules decreases, causing an increase in density.


                                CHOOSING SUITABLE SOLVENTS
                                For a substance to dissolve, the following two conditions must be met.

                                1   The solute particles must be separated from each other and then become surrounded by solvent
                                    particles.

                                2   The forces of attraction between the solute and solvent particles must be strong enough to
                                    overcome the solvent—solvent forces and the solute—solute forces.

                                Many ionic solids dissolve in water. The energy required to separate the ions in the solid is either
                                completely, or partially, supplied by the hydration of the ions.

COMPOUNDS THAT CAN FORM HYDROGEN BONDS WITH WATER
Alcohols contain an -O—H group and can therefore form hydrogen bonds with water.

A     figF    Hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water.

Ethanol and water mix in all proportions. The hydrogen bonding between the ethanol and water
molecules is similar in strength to the hydrogen bonding in pure ethanol and in pure water.

The solubility of alcohols in water decreases with increasing hydrocarbon chain length as London
forces predominate between the alcohol molecules.


COMPOUNDS THAT CANNOT FORM HYDROGEN BONDS WITH WATER
Non-polar molecules such as the alkanes do not dissolve in water. The attraction between the alkane
molecules and water molecules is not sufficiently strong to disrupt the hydrogen bonded system
between the water molecules.

Many polar molecules also have limited solubility in water. This is because they either do not form
hydrogen bonds with water, or the hydrogen bonds they do form are weak compared with the
hydrogen bonds in water.

Ethoxyethane, CH;CH;OCH,CH;, is polar (dipole moment = 1.15 D) and yet is almost totally
immiscible with water. The forces of attraction between ethoxyethane and water molecules are not
large enough to replace the relatively strong hydrogen bonding between the water molecules.

Halogenoalkanes (see Topic 10) are also not very soluble in water for similar reasons. They are
much more soluble in ethanol, and this is why some reactions of halogenoalkanes are carried out in a
medium of aqueous ethanol.


NON-AQUEOUS SOLVENTS
A general rule is that ‘like dissolves like’. In other words, substances that are very similar dissolve
each other. If you are searching for a solvent for a non-polar substance, or for a substance that has
a substantial non-polar part to its molecule, then liquids that contain similar molecules are often

         AND GROUPS 1, 2 AND 7

em       Redox reactions are among the most common and most important chemical reactions in everyday life.                      pee
—        Here are two examples of redox reactions that occur in our daily lives:                                                re ears

             1    One of the most common chemical reactions, combustion, is a classic redox reaction. For example, when
                  petrol burns within the internal combustion engine of a car, carbon atoms in the fuel are oxidised to
                  carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. As this is happening, oxygen in the air is reduced when it combines
                  with the hydrogen atoms of the fuel to form water.

             2 Photosynthesis is probably the single most important process on the planet. It uses the energy of sunlight
                  to grow plants and so provide food for all higher organisms. Photosynthesis is accomplished through a
                  series of redox reactions in which energy from light is finally converted into carbohydrates on which
                  animals and humans can feed. Oxygen is also a vital by-product of photosynthesis.

         The Periodic Table of elements is a familiar feature in any study of chemistry. It helps us to make sense of the
         variety of chemical elements and their different reactions, some of which are redox reactions. It also helps us
         to make sense of the even greater variety of chemical compounds of the elements. In this topic, we will focus
         mostly on three groups (columns) of the Periodic Table to illustrate the trends within the groups and several
         features of the elements and compounds in them.

         In these groups, you will meet familiar elements such as magnesium and chlorine, but also less familiar
         elements such as barium and bromine. For example, you will learn how the limewater test for carbon dioxide
         works, how milk of magnesia relieves indigestion and why farmers spread lime on their fields. You will learn
         that although barium compounds are very poisonous, you can safely eat a‘barium meal’ before having an
         X-ray.

         By learning how flame tests work, you will also understand how fireworks can have flames of different colours.
         The use of chlorine and its compounds in disinfectants and bleaches has saved many lives, and you will learn
         something of the chemistry involved in how these products work.

         You will also learn about titrations, especially how to do them accurately, and carry out calculations from results.

BACKGROUND TO OXIDATION AND REDUCTION                                        The magnesium has been oxidised because it has gained oxygen.
                                                                             The oxygen must have been reduced, but by what definition?
You originally knew ‘oxidation’ as the addition of oxygen and
‘reduction’ as the removal of oxygen.                                        The reaction results in the formation of Mg?* and O7 ions. Each

Therefore, oxygen is an oxidising agent.                                                                     EXAM HINT

The magnesium has reduced the oxygen and is therefore a reducing agent.                                      An oxidising agent is reduced.


DISPROPORTIONATION
Consider the following reaction, which occurs if copper(I) oxide is added to dilute sulfuric acid:

          Cu,O(s) + H,SO, — CuSO,(aq) + Cu(s) + H,O(I)

One of the Cu* ions in copper(I) oxide has lost an electron to become Cu?*. At the same time, the
other Cu” ion has gained an electron to become Cu. Both oxidation and reduction have occurred but
the same element, copper, is involved in both changes.

This is an example of a disproportionation reaction.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

MH Know what is meant by the term oxidation number and understand the rules for assigning oxidation numbers.

MTM@ Be able to calculate the oxidation number of elements in compounds and ions, including in peroxides and metal hydrides.

M@ Understand that metals, in general, form positive ions by loss of electrons with an increase in oxidation number whereas
   non-metals, in general, form negative ions by gain of electrons with a decrease in oxidation number.


                                OXIDATION NUMBER
                                So far we have restricted our discussion of oxidation and reduction to atoms and ions. For redox
                                reactions involving these species it is easy to see which species are losing and which are gaining
                                electrons. However, many compounds are covalent and for them a simple treatment involving ions is
                                not appropriate.

                                To get around this difficulty, the concept of oxidation number has been developed.

                                For example, in MgO the oxidation number of magnesium is +2, since the charge on the magnesium
                                ion is 2*. Similarly, the oxidation number of oxygen is —2.

                                In SO,, the oxidation number of the sulfur is +4 because if the compound were fully ionic the sulfur
                                ion would have a charge of 4*. The oxidation number of oxygen is once again —2.


                                RULES FOR DETERMINING THE OXIDATION NUMBER
                                Here are some rules to help you calculate the oxidation number.
                                ¢    The oxidation number of an uncombined element is zero.
                                ¢    The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in a neutral compound is zero.
                                ¢    The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
                                ¢    The more electronegative element in a substance is given a negative oxidation number.
                                ¢    The oxidation number of fluorine is always —1.
                                ¢    The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when combined with a less electronegative
                                      element. Then it becomes —1.
                                ¢    The oxidation number of oxygen is —2, except in peroxides where it is —1 and when combined
                                     with fluorine when it is +2.

                                The best way to get used to these rules is to put them into practice, which is what we shall now do.

   (a) N is more electronegative than H and must therefore have a negative oxidation number. The
       oxidation number of H is therefore +1. The oxidation numbers must add up to zero, so the oxidation

   (b) O is more electronegative than N, so the oxidation number of O is —2. The oxidation numbers must
       add up to -1 (the charge on the ion), so the oxidation number of N is +3.

                 OXIDATION NUMBERS

M Understand oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer and changes in oxidation number, and the application of
    these ideas to reactions of s-block and p-block elements.
® Know that the oxidation number is a useful concept in terms of the classification of reactions as redox and as disproportionation.


                                   USING OXIDATION NUMBERS TO CLASSIFY REACTIONS
                                   Consider the following ionic half-equations:
                                            Zn(s) — Zn?*(aq) + 2e7
                                            Fe2*(aq) — Fe?*(aq) + e7
                                            21-(aq) — I,(aq) + 2e7

                                   In all three cases, electrons have been lost so the reactions are oxidations. But also notice that the
                                   oxidation number of the element has increased in each case.
                                   e     Zn has increased from 0 to +2.
                                   ¢     Fe has increased from +2 to +3.
                                   e     | has increased from —1 to 0.

                                   This leads to another definition of oxidation and reduction.

                                   Consider the following ionic half-equations:

                                            Cl,(aq) + 2e~- — 2CI (aq)                                    Cl changes from 0 to -1

an oxidation number of +6.         This concept can now be applied to full equations.

                                       Use oxidation numbers to show whether the following reactions are examples of redox reactions.

                                          (a)                    H,S(g) + Cl.(g) — 2HCI(g) + S(s)

                                       Answer
                                       The oxidation number of S has increased (-2 to 0), so it has been oxidised.
                                       The oxidation number of Cl has decreased (0 to -1), so it has been reduced.
                                       Since both oxidation and reduction have taken place, the reaction is classified as a redox reaction.

                                       Answer
                                       There is no change in oxidation number for any of the elements involved in the reaction, so this is not
                                       an example of a redox reaction.

                                       Answer
                                       The oxidation number of Cl has both increased (0 in Cl, to +1 in NaClO) and decreased (0 in Cl, to -1 in
                                       NaCl), so this is an example of a redox reaction.
                                       It is also an example of a disproportionation reaction.

REACTIONS OF S-BLOCK ELEMENTS
We can make some predictions about the reactions of s-block elements in terms of redox.
Reactive metals in Groups 1 and 2 lose electrons when they react. For example, the Group 1 element
sodium loses one electron, which can be represented in this ionic half-equation:

       Na — Nat +e&

At the same time, you can also recognise that this involves an increase in oxidation number from 0 to +1.

Magnesium, a Group 2 metal, reacts in a similar way:

       Mg — Mg?* + 2e-
This involves an increase in oxidation number from 0 to +2.

You will learn more about these reactions in Topic 8B.

REACTIONS OF P-BLOCK ELEMENTS
We can also make some predictions about the reactions of p-block elements in terms of redox.
Unfortunately, it is not as straightforward as with s-block elements. This is because the p-block
contains elements with different characteristics. For example, the Group 3 element aluminium is a
metal with a reactivity nearly as high as magnesium, so it reacts in a similar way:

      Al — Al** + 3e
This involves an increase in oxidation number from 0 to +3.

Now consider the Group 7 element fluorine, which is the most reactive halogen. The half-equation for
its reaction is:

       Fo +2e€° — 2F-

This involves a decrease in oxidation number from 0 to —1.

Nitrogen is a p-block element in Group 5, with an electronegativity higher than aluminium, but lower
than fluorine. What predictions can we make about the change in oxidation number in its reactions?
This depends on which element it reacts with.
For example, nitrogen reacts with the Group 1 metal sodium as follows:

       6Na + N, — 2Na,N

In this redox reaction, the oxidation number of sodium increases from 0 to +1, and that of nitrogen
decreases from 0 to —3.

Now consider nitrogen’s reaction with fluorine:



As always, the oxidation number of fluorine decreases from 0 to —1, but this time the oxidation
number of nitrogen increases from 0 to +3. You will learn more about these reactions in Topic 8C.

                               When an element can have more than one oxidation state, the names of its compounds and its ions
                               often include the oxidation number of the element, written as a Roman numeral in brackets. This

                                            systematic name.



                               WHEN TO USE SYSTEMATIC NAMES
                               We often use systematic names in chemistry so that we can be specific about the compounds and
                               ions we are referring to. However, in the wider world the numbers are often left out.
                               For example:

                                ¢     the systematic name for Na,SO, is sodium sulfate(V1), but it is often just called sodium sulfate
                                ¢     Na,SO, should be labelled sodium sulfate(IV), but the name sodium sulfite is still commonly used

                                ¢     SO, and SO; are more commonly referred to as sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, rather than
                                      sulfur(IV) oxide and sulfur(VI) oxide, respectively.
                               You should use systematic names as often as possible, particularly during your studies.


                               WRITING FORMULAE WHEN YOU HAVE THE OXIDATION NUMBER
                               The other skill you need to develop is to work backwards from the oxidation number to deduce the
                               formula of the compound or ion concerned.



                                    WORKED EXAMPLE 1

                                    The formula of the iron(II) ion is Fe*.
                                    The formula of the sulfate ion is SOZ.
                                    So the two ions are present in a 1:1 ratio to produce a neutral compound, giving the formula FeSO,.

chloride, the iron(II) ions are oxidised to iron(III) ions and the            MnOj(aq) + 8H*(aq) + 5e~ — Mn?*(aq) + 4H,O(l) and
chlorine molecules are reduced to chloride ions.
                                                                                                     H,O0.(aq) — 2H*(aq) + O,(g) + 2e7
The two ionic half-equations are:
                                                                        The lowest common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10. This means that the

This time, one of the half-equations contains one electron, while
the other contains two electrons. Before these can be added                2MnO;(aq) + 16H*(aq) + 10e~- + 2Mn?*(aq) + 8H,O(I)

must be multiplied by 2.

BALANCING USING OXIDATION NUMBERS

WORKED EXAMPLE 1
Use oxidation numbers to balance the following equation:
...5O>(g) + ....H,O(I) + ....Ag*(aq) — .... SOF(aq) + ....H*(aq) + ....Ag(s)
Answer

Identify the elements whose oxidation numbers have changed.
In this case:

 -   Schanges from +4 to +6; this is a ‘2 electron’ change
 -   Agchanges from +1 to 0; this is a ‘1 electron’ change.

So the ratio of SO, to Ag” is 1: 2. This gives:

        SO,(g) + ....H,O(I) + 2Ag*(aq) + SO7 (aq) +       ....H*(aq) + 2Ag(s)
We now need to balance the H and O atoms.
This gives:

        SO,(g) + 2H,O(I) + 2Ag*(aq) — SOZ (aq) + 4H*(aq) + 2Ag(s)
Lastly, check the equation for balanced charges.

 -   The total charge on the left-hand side is 2+.
     The total charge on the right-hand side is also 2+ (-2 + +4).
The equation is now balanced.



WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Use oxidation numbers to balance the following equation:
        ww F@2* + ....ClO3 + ....H* — .... Fe** + ....Cl- + ....H
                                                               20
Answer

Identify the elements whose oxidation numbers have changed.
In this case:

Fe changes from +2 to +3; this is a‘l electron’ change

Cl changes from +5 to -1; this is a ‘6 electron’ change.
So the ratio of Fe to ClO; is 6: 1. This gives:
        6Fe2* + CIO; + ....H* — 6Fe** + Cl +....H,O
Once again, balance the H and O atoms.

This gives:

        6Fe?* + ClO3 + 6H* — 6Fe** + Cl + 3H,O
Check the charges.

 *   The total charge on the left-hand side is +17((6 x +2) + -1 + (6 x +1)).
 -   The total charge on the right-hand side is +17((6 x +3) + -1).
The equation is now balanced.

*    As each quantum shell is added, energy of the outermost electrons increases. This means a
     decrease in ionisation energy down the group.
*    As the number of filled inner shells increases, their force of repulsion on the electron being
     removed increases. This means a decrease in ionisation energy down the group.

You can see that the first factor causes an increase, but the second and third factors cause a
decrease. The combined effect of the second and third factors outweighs the effect of the first factor.
This means that there is a decrease down the group.


TREND IN REACTIVITY
We will look at the reactions of the elements of Groups 1 and 2 in Topics 8B.2 to 8B.6. In all these
reactions, the element changes into either an M* ion or an M?* ion, and there is a general increase
in reactivity down the group. This can be explained by the decrease in energy needed to remove the
electron from each atom of the element.


    LEARNING TIP
When writing an equation for an ionisation, you should always include the state symbol (g) after each
atom and ion.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 MTM Know the reactions of the elements of Group 2 (Mg to Ba) with oxygen, chlorine and water.


REACTIONS WITH OXYGEN                                                                                       (a)
You should be familiar with the reaction that occurs when magnesium burns in air — there is a very
bright flame and the formation of a white solid.

Similar observations can be made when other Group 2 elements burn in air, but they are qualitatively
different, that is, you should be able to recognise that when calcium, strontium and barium are
heated in air, the reactions are more vigorous. However, this may be hard to see if the metals are not
fresh samples. If the burning metal is placed in a gas jar of oxygen, then the same reaction occurs,
although more vigorously.

For all these elements, the element needs to be heated for the reaction to start. However, even without
heating, there is a slow reaction between the element and oxygen when the element is exposed to air.
This forms a surface coating of oxide which helps to prevent the element from further reaction.

Barium is the most reactive. It is often stored under oil to keep it from reacting with oxygen and water
vapour in the air.                                                                                          (b)

The general equation for all these reactions is:

      2M(s) + O,(g) + 2MO(s)
The products are oxides containing M** and O7 ions.

REACTIONS WITH CHLORINE
The Group 2 elements combine with chlorine when heated in the gas. Just like the reactions with
oxygen, the reactions with chlorine become more vigorous down the group. However, this trend is
harder to see than with the oxygen reactions. Fig B shows what magnesium burning in a flask of
chlorine gas looks like.

The general equation for all of these reactions is:

      M(s) + Cl,(g) + MC1,(s)
The products are chlorides containing M’* and Cl ions.


REACTIONS WITH WATER                                                                                        A figA (a) Burning magnesium

strontium and barium react with increasing vigour (i.e. reactivity increases down the group), which
can be seen by the increase in effervescence.

In fig C, you can see that a piece of magnesium in water is covered with bubbles of hydrogen gas,
but that the reaction is not very vigorous.

Fig D shows piece of calcium in water is also covered with bubbles of hydrogen gas, but the reaction
is more vigorous.

                          The general equation for all of these reactions is:

                                M(s) + 2H,O(!) + M(OH),(aq) + H,(g)
                          The products are hydrogen gas and hydroxides containing M** and OH7 ions.
                          The equation for the reaction with calcium is:

                                Ca(s) + 2H,O(l) — Ca(OH),(s) + H,(g)
                          Calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water, so the liquid in this experiment goes cloudy as a
                          precipitate of calcium hydroxide forms.

                         The equation for the reaction with barium is:

                                Ba(s) + 2H,O(I) — Ba(OH),(aq) + H,(g)
                          Note the difference in the state symbol for the hydroxide in these equations, as barium hydroxide is
                          soluble in water. You will learn more about the solubility of Group 2 hydroxides in the next topic.


                          MAGNESIUM AND STEAM
                          Magnesium reacts differently when heated in steam — it rapidly forms magnesium oxide (a white
                         solid) and hydrogen gas in a vigorous reaction. The equation for this reaction is:

                                Mg(s) + H,O(g) + MgO(s) + H,(g)

                          In a similar way to Group 1, the trend is increasing reactivity down the group, so you should be
                         able to predict that beryllium is less reactive than magnesium, and that radium is more reactive

 TM Know the reactions of the oxides of Group 1 and 2 elements with water and dilute acid, and their hydroxides with dilute acid.
 ® Know the trends in solubility of the hydroxides and sulfates of Group 2 elements.
 ® Know the reactions, including ionic equations where appropriate, for identifying carbonate and sulfate ions.


REACTIONS OF THE OXIDES WITH WATER
The Group 1 and 2 oxides are classed as basic oxides, which means that they can react with water
to form alkalis. These reactions occur when the oxides are added to water. The only observation
we can make is that the solids react to form colourless solutions. The general equations for these
reactions are:

      for Group 1 oxides:   M,O(s) + H,O(l) — 2MOH(aq)

      for Group 2 oxides:   MO(s) + H,O(l) — M(OH),(aq)

These equations can be simplified because there is no change to the M* or M?* ion during the reactions.

      O27" + H,0 — 20H

This equation shows the formation of hydroxide ions, which is why the resulting solutions
are alkaline.


TRENDS IN SOLUBILITY OF THE GROUP 2 HYDROXIDES
The pH value of the alkaline solution formed depends partly on the relative amounts of oxide and
water, but is also affected by differences in the solubility of the hydroxides.

For example, when magnesium oxide reacts with water, the magnesium hydroxide formed has a very
low solubility in water. The solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides increases down the group. Therefore,
the maximum alkalinity (pH value) of the solutions formed also increases down the group.


TESTING FOR CARBON DIOXIDE
You may remember from your previous study of chemistry that limewater is used to test for carbon
dioxide. It goes cloudy (or milky) as a white precipitate forms. Limewater is the name used for a
saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide. Carbon dioxide reacts to form calcium carbonate,
the white precipitate, which is insoluble in water. The equation for the reaction is:
                                                                                                          A   figA As carbon dioxide is

As carbon dioxide is bubbled through limewater, the amount of precipitate increases (fig A).


MILK OF MAGNESIA
For over a century, a suspension of magnesium hydroxide in water has been sold as an indigestion
remedy called milk of magnesia. A bottle of this contains a saturated solution of magnesium
hydroxide mixed with extra solid magnesium hydroxide, which acts as an antacid.

The human stomach contains hydrochloric acid that is needed to digest food, but sometimes there is
too much acid and the person develops symptoms of indigestion. Taking milk of magnesia neutralises
some of the hydrochloric acid and relieves the symptoms. The equation for the reaction is:

      Mg(OH), + 2HCl — MgCl, + 2H,O

Although hydroxide ions attack human tissue, the very low solubility of magnesium hydroxide means
that the concentration of OH ions in the medicine is also very low and is not a risk to health.           A figB Abottle of milk of

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    MTM Understand the reasons for the trends in thermal stability of the nitrates and the carbonates of the elements in Groups 1 and 2
       in terms of the size and charge of the cations involved.
    TM Know experimental procedures used to show patterns in the thermal decomposition of Group 1 and 2 nitrates and carbonates.


FACTORS AFFECTING THERMAL STABILITY
Thermal stability is a term that indicates how stable a compound is when it is heated. Does it
not decompose at all (very thermally stable), or does it decompose as much as possible (not at all
thermally stable), or somewhere in between?

You are familiar with ionic bonding in compounds and you know that the bond strength is responsible
for physical properties such as the melting temperature. For example, the high melting temperature
of sodium chloride (NaCl) can be explained in terms of the strong electrostatic forces of attraction
between the large numbers of oppositely charged Na* and Cl ions. When sodium chloride melts, the
ions change from being regularly arranged in a giant lattice to moving freely in a liquid. There is no
decomposition occurring in this change of state.

The situation with Group 2 nitrates and carbonates is very different compared with a Group 1
chloride such as sodium chloride. There are three reasons for this.
1    The charge on a Group 2 cation is double that on a Group 1 cation (e.g. Ca2* compared with Na’).
2    The size (ionic radius) of a Group 2 cation is smaller than that of the Group 1 cation in the
     same period.

3    The nitrate (NO,~) and carbonate (CO") anions are more complex than the Cl" ion.

These differences mean that when Group 2 nitrates and carbonates are heated, they do not melt.
Instead, they decompose. We need to look carefully at these factors to understand why this is.
¢    The larger, more complex nitrate ion can change into the smaller, more stable nitrite ion (NOZ) or
     oxide ion (O?-) by decomposing and releasing oxygen gas and/or nitrogen dioxide gas.
¢    The larger, more complex carbonate ion can change into the smaller, more stable oxide ion (O77)
     by decomposing and releasing carbon dioxide gas, CO).
¢    The stabilities of the nitrate and carbonate anions are influenced by the charge and size of the
     cations present. Smaller and more highly charged cations affect these anions more.

Table A shows the charge and radius for each of the ions in Groups 1 and 2.

You can see that the cation with the greatest influence (biggest charge and smallest size) on an anion
is Be**, and the one with the least influence (smallest charge and largest size) is Cs*.

THERMAL STABILITY OF NITRATES
All of the nitrates of the Group 1 and Group 2 elements are white solids. When they are heated, they
all decompose to nitrites or oxides, and give off nitrogen dioxide (brown fumes) and/or oxygen. If the
nitrate contains water of crystallisation, then steam will also be observed.
204   8B.5 THERMAL STABILITY OF COMPOUNDS                                     TOPIC 8

                                  If no brown fumes are observed, this indicates a lesser decomposition. This decomposition can be
                                  represented by this word equation:

                                           metal nitrate — metal nitrite + oxygen

                                  Oxygen gas cannot be observed as it is colourless. It can be detected using a glowing spill or splint,
                                  which relights if oxygen is present.

                                  Nitrates and nitrites are sometimes differentiated by using oxidation numbers — nitrate(V) for nitrate,
                                  and nitrate(III) for nitrite.

                                  If brown fumes are observed, this indicates a greater decomposition that can be represented by this
                                  word equation:

                                           metal nitrate — metal oxide + nitrogen dioxide + oxygen

                                  You can see that the greater decomposition occurs when:
                                  ¢     the cation has a 2+ charge (all of the Group 2 nitrates)
                                  ¢     the cation has a 1+ charge and is also the smallest Group 1 cation.

THERMAL STABILITY OF CARBONATES
All of the carbonates of the Group 1 and Group 2 elements
are white solids. When they are heated, they either do not
decompose, or decompose to oxides and give off carbon dioxide.

As the gas given off is colourless and the carbonate and oxide are
both white solids, there are no observations that can be made.

Table D shows what happens when samples of carbonates are
heated in test tubes over a Bunsen flame.

                                INTRODUCTION TO THE GROUP 7 ELEMENTS
                                Group 7 of the Periodic Table contains five elements. These elements are often known as halogens
                                and they all form salts called halides. The term ‘halogen’ comes from Greek and means ‘salt producer’.

                                When considering the properties of the group, the elements at the top and bottom of the group
                                (fluorine and astatine) are often ignored. Fluorine is ignored because it sometimes behaves differently
                                from chlorine, bromine and iodine, and astatine is ignored because (like radium in Group 2) it only
                                exists as radioactive isotopes.

                                Table A shows some information about the Group 7 elements.

                                TRENDS IN MELTING AND BOILING TEMPERATURE
                                All of the halogens exist as diatomic molecules, so their melting and boiling temperatures depend on
                                the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between these molecules. We looked at these
                                forces, known as London forces, in Topic 7. Here is a reminder of how they happen.

                                As the two atoms in the diatomic molecule are identical, the pair of electrons forming the covalent
                                bond between them is shared equally between the two atoms. This means that the halogen molecules
                                are non-polar, at least on average. However, as the positive charges of the protons in the two nuclei
                                are in fixed positions, but the electron density in a halogen molecule continuously fluctuates,
                                sometimes the centres of positive and negative charge do not coincide. This situation results in a
                                temporary dipole, which is often referred to as an instantaneous dipole.

                                We will use a rectangular shape to represent a halogen molecule. The two dots represent the nuclei
                                of the two halogen atoms. When two molecules are close together, you would expect no interaction
                                between the two because they are both non-polar.

                                If the molecule on the left becomes an instantaneous dipole, then it will cause an induced dipole in
                                the molecule on the right. This results in a force of attraction between the two molecules:
                                    6+         6—                                               6+              O=    5+           6—

This force of attraction is described as an instantaneous dipole—induced dipole attraction, and these
are the intermolecular forces of attraction that exist between halogen molecules. These weak forces
increase as the number of electrons and therefore the size of the electron cloud increases. The
forces increase in strength down Group 7 as the number of electrons in the molecules increases. This
explains the increase in both melting temperature and boiling temperature down Group 7.


EQUATIONS FOR CHANGES OF STATE
You are probably used to writing equations for chemical changes, but we use equations for physical
changes less often. As well as using the correct state symbols, it is important to remember to write
the formulae (not the symbols) of the halogens.

When bromine is left at room temperature, it gives off brown vapour, as its boiling point (59°C) is not
much higher than room temperature. The equation for this change is:

         Br,(1) — Br,(g)
When iodine is warmed, most of it changes directly into a vapour without melting. This change is
called sublimation. The equation for this change is:

         [,(s) — I,(g)

TREND IN ELECTRONEGATIVITY
We have already seen in Topic 3B that electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract the
pair of electrons in a covalent bond. The 0-4 scale devised by Linus Pauling is still used. The
electronegativity of an atom depends on:
*     its nuclear charge — the bigger the nuclear charge, the higher the electronegativity
¢     the distance between the nucleus and the bonding pair of electrons — the shorter the distance,
      the higher the electronegativity
      the shielding effect of electrons in inner energy levels — the fewer energy levels, the higher
      the electronegativity.

The electronegativity of the Group 7 elements is the highest of any group in the Periodic Table.
The electronegativity of fluorine is the highest of all elements.


TREND IN REACTIVITY
Fluorine is an extremely reactive element, and reactivity decreases down Group 7. Because of
                                                                                                          LEARNING TIP

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    M Understand the trend in reactivity of Group 7 elements in terms of the redox reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine with
       halide ions in aqueous solution, followed by the addition of an organic solvent.
    MTM Understand, in terms of changes in oxidation number, oxidation reactions of the halogens with Group 1 and 2 metals and
       disproportionation reactions of chlorine with water, and with cold and hot alkali.


REACTIONS WITH METALS IN GROUPS 1 AND 2
There are 12 elements in Groups 1 and 2, and 5 elements in
Group 7, so there are 60 possible reactions to consider. You do not
need to know details of all of these reactions, but here are some
useful generalisations that you should know.

¢    Reactions are most vigorous between elements at the bottom
     of Groups 1 and 2, and elements at the top of Group 7.
     The most vigorous reaction should be between caesium
     (or francium) and fluorine, and the least vigorous between
     beryllium and iodine (or astatine).
¢    The products of these reactions are salts, ionic solids that are
     usually white.
¢    All of these reactions involve electron transfer to the halogen,
     so they are redox reactions in which the halogen acts as an
     oxidising agent.
¢    The oxidation number of the halogen decreases from 0 to —1,
     and the oxidation number of the metal increases from 0 to +1
     or +2, depending on the group.

water’ (just as ‘bromine water’ is used to refer to bromine dissolved in water). Some of the dissolved
chlorine also reacts to form a mixture of two acids.

You are familiar with one of the acids, hydrochloric acid, but the other acid is chloric(I) acid (its old
name is hypochlorous acid). Its formula is shown in the equation below as HCIO, but HOC! is also
commonly used. Both acids are colourless solutions, so there is no visible change during the reaction.

The disproportionation that occurs can be shown using oxidation numbers:

      Cl, + H,O0 — HCl + HClO
      0                  —1     chlorine is reduced

      0                            +1   chlorine is oxidised

The addition of chlorine to disinfect water for drinking purposes has saved countless lives, and
continues to do so today. It kills the pathogens responsible for water-borne diseases such as cholera.

CHLORINE WITH COLD ALKALI
When chlorine is added to cold dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, it reacts to form the salts of the
acids in the equation above. These salts are sodium chloride and sodium chlorate(I), which is also
known as sodium hypochlorite.

Again, the disproportionation that occurs can be shown using oxidation numbers:

      Cl, + 2NaOQH — NaCl + NaClO + H,O

      0                       —1    chlorine is reduced

      0                                   +1   chlorine is oxidised

The sodium chlorate(I) formed is also a disinfectant, but it is mainly known for its bleaching action. It
is used extensively in industry and is the active ingredient in household bleach.


CHLORINE WITH HOT ALKALI
When chlorine is added to hot concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, it reacts to form sodium
chloride and a different product, sodium chlorate(V).

                          Again, the disproportionation that occurs can be shown using oxidation numbers:

                                3Cl, + 6NaOH — 5NaCl + NaClO, + 3H,O

                                0                         —1   chlorine is reduced

                                0                                  +5   chlorine is oxidised

                          The sodium chlorate(V) formed is also used in bleaching, and as a weed killer.

                          Bromine and iodine react in similar ways.

                          If you are asked to predict reactions of fluorine and astatine that you are not familiar with, then you
                          can use information in this topic to help you. For example, you could write an equation to represent
                          the reaction between sodium and astatine, based on your knowledge of the reaction between sodium
                          and iodine.

M@ Understand the reactions of solid Group 1 halides with concentrated sulfuric acid, to illustrate the trend in reducing ability of
       the hydrogen halides.


REDOX REACTIONS AGAIN
In Topics 8A.3, 8C.1 and 8C.2, you have learnt about several examples of the halogens acting as
oxidising agents, and you know that this oxidising power decreases down the group.
In this topic, we will look at reactions of halide ions, not halogen molecules. It is important to realise that in
these reactions, the halides act as reducing agents, and that the trend is different. This is shown in table A.

    OXIDISING | HALOGEN                 HALIDE                  REDUCING

      Low | astatine           At,      astatide     At             High
table A Notice that the decreasing trend down the group in oxidising power of halogens goes with the increasing trend
        in reducing power of halides.

The reducing action of halide ions can be represented by this general half-equation:

        2X” — X, + 2e7

Sulfuric acid is of course an acid, but when concentrated it contains very few ions. We can write an
equation for its partial ionisation:

        H,SO, = H* + HSO;

Note the reversible arrow. The position of this equilibrium lies well to the left in the concentrated
acid, and this first ionisation is far from complete. The second ionisation, to produce sulfate ions,
occurs only to a small extent in the concentrated acid:

        HsOp = h’+s02:

Sulfuric acid, especially when concentrated, can act as an oxidising agent as well as an acid. When
it acts as an oxidising agent, it is reduced, but the extent of its reduction and the products formed
depend on the species being oxidised.

The three possible reduction products are:
¢    sulfur dioxide
*    sulfur
¢    hydrogen sulfide.

Three different half-equations can be written to represent its oxidising action. Note the change in
oxidation number of the sulfur in each case:

Half-equation 1.       H,SO, + 2H* + 2e7 — 2H,O + SOp
                         +6                                +4

Half-equation 2.       H SO, + 6H* + 6e" — 4H,0 +S
                         +6                                0

Half-equation 3.       H,SO, + 8H* + 8e" — 4H,O + HS
                         +6                                    -2
214   8C.3 REACTIONS OF HALIDES WITH SULFURIC ACID                            TOPIC 8

                                  These half-equations may look complicated at first, but you should be able to see the pattern.
                                  ¢ In half-equation 1, the decrease in oxidation number (+6 to +4) is 2, which is the same as the
                                    numbers of H* ions and electrons in the equation.
                                  ¢ The pattern is similar in the other two equations. The decrease in oxidation number of the sulfur
                                    is the same as the numbers of H* ions and electrons in the half-equation (6 in reaction 2, 8 in
                                      reaction 3).

                                       sodium bromide) and iodine (formed from sodium iodide).

                                  The tube on the left in fig A shows no colour. These are the misty fumes of hydrogen chloride,
                                  formed from sodium chloride. The tube in the middle contains brown fumes. This is bromine, formed
                                  from sodium bromide. The tube on the right contains purple fumes. This is iodine, formed from
                                  sodium iodide.
                                  With sodium chloride, the sulfuric acid behaves only as an acid, and not as an oxidising agent. This is
                                  because chloride ions have low reducing power.
                                  With sodium bromide, the greater reducing power of bromide ions causes the sulfuric acid to be
                                  reduced, as in half-equation 1 above.
                                  With sodium iodide, the much greater reducing power of iodide ions causes the sulfuric acid to be
                                  reduced, as in half-equations 1, 2 and 3.

                                  CONSTRUCTING EQUATIONS
                                  Some of the equations you see, or are asked to write, may look very complicated and be hard
                                  to remember It is better not to try to remember them, but to work them out by the addition of
                                  half-equations. This method is recommended for the redox equations of sodium bromide and
                                  sodium iodide.

SODIUM BROMIDE
The formation of the brown fumes of hydrogen bromide can be represented by an equation
analogous to the one for sodium chloride:

NaBr + H,SO, — NaHSO, + HBr

The table of observations shows that only one redox reaction occurs: the formation of sulfur dioxide
in half-equation 1. The two relevant half-equations are:

        2Br — Br, + 2e€-

and
        H,SO, + 2H* + 2e° — 2H,0O + SO,
Adding these together, then cancelling the 2e” on each side, gives:
        2B FiO, Plo = 2 + 5Oet_. Br

You could combine the ions on the left to give:
        2HBr + H,SO, — 2H,O0 + SO, + Br,
This equation represents the oxidation of the misty fumes of hydrogen bromide.

SODIUM IODIDE
The formation of the purple fumes of hydrogen iodide can be represented by an equation analogous to
the one for sodium chloride:

        Nal + H,SO, — NaHSO, + HI
The table of observations shows that three redox reactions occur, so the situation is more
complicated. You could construct an equation showing the formation of sulfur dioxide in the same
way as for sodium bromide.

Here is the result of applying the same method to the formation of sulfur in half-equation 2. The two
relevant half-equations are:
        21-— I, + 2e7
and



Before you add these together, you need to multiply the first one by three, so that the 6e~ on each
side will cancel, giving:

        6I- + H,SO, + 6H* — 4H,0 + § + 3l,

You could combine the ions on the left to give:

        6HI + H,SO, — 4H,0 + S + 31,

This equation represents the oxidation of the misty fumes of hydrogen iodide.

You should now be able to use the same method to construct an equation to represent the oxidation
of the misty fumes of hydrogen iodide to form hydrogen sulfide.


 LEARNING TIP
 Look carefully at all of the equations in this topic. Make sure you can identify whether they are redox
 reactions and, if so, what the extent of the reaction is.

 LEARNING TIP
 Look carefully at each step of the method. How does each step contribute to the accuracy of the final value
of the concentration?




When making a standard solution in a volumetric flask, it is important to ensure that the lowest part
of the liquid (the meniscus) is aligned with the graduation mark.

                                            WHAT IS A TITRATION?
                                            A titration is a practical method with the aim of measuring the volumes of two solutions that react
                                            together, and using the results to calculate the concentration of one of the solutions. Because the
                                            method involves measuring volumes, it is sometimes known as volumetric analysis.

                                            You may come across different titration types (redox titrations and complexometric titrations), but
                                            in this book we will consider only acid-base titrations. Many, but not all, bases are soluble in water,
                                            which makes them alkalis. They are often referred to as acid—alkali titrations.
                                            All of the acids and bases you will use in titrations are colourless, as are the products, so there
                                            is nothing to see when the reaction is complete. This problem is solved by using an indicator, a
                                            substance which has different colours in acids and bases/alkalis.
                                            In the method described in this topic, we will assume that a solution of sodium hydroxide of
                                            approximate concentration 0.1 moldm”° is available and that the standard solution of sulfamic
                                            acid referred to in Topic 8D.1 will be used. The aim is to calculate an accurate value for the
                                            concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution. The method will be described in some detail, and
                                            we will focus on avoiding common errors in technique.
                                            In some titrations, it is important to choose which way round to do the titration (which solution goes
                                            in the pipette and which solution in the burette). In other titrations, it does not matter.

  E                                         OUTLINE OF THE TITRATION METHOD
                                            Here is an outline of the titration method that introduces some key terms.

                                            ¢       Repeat the titration until concordant titres are obtained.

                                  CALCULATING THE MEAN (AVERAGE) TITRE
                                  The terms ‘average’ and ‘mean’ are often used interchangeably, but in scientific work you should take
                                  care to use the proper word. ‘Average’ has more than one mathematical meaning — it can represent
                                  the mean, the median or the mode. For these calculations you should use the mean: a set of values
                                  added to give a total, which is then divided by the number of values.
                                  Before calculating a mean titre, only the concordant values must be selected, i.e. those that are
                                  within 0.20 cm? of each other. Table A shows some typical titration results and a student’s choice of
                                  concordant titres.

                                  table A A set of titration results and a student's choice of concordant titres.

                                  In this example, titrations 2, 3 and 4 are all within 0.20 cm? of each other and so have been correctly
                                  ticked as concordant. It is not surprising that titration 1 is not concordant because it is normal
                                  practice to do the first titration more quickly to obtain a rough titre, so the end point is more likely
                                  to be overshot. This saves time in the long run because in the other titrations the liquid in the burette
                                  can be added quickly at first, until the end point is close, then added much more slowly.
                                  This is how to calculate the mean:

                                          _ 22.60 + 22.70 + 22.65
                                  Mean                                    = 22.65 cm?

                                   WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                                   Here is a typical set of titration results from the method given in Topic 8D.2.
                                   volume of sodium hydroxide solution used             = 25.0cm?
                                   volume of sulfamic acid solution used                = 22.65cm?
                                   concentration of sulfamic acid solution              = 0.0985 mol dm-?
                                   The equation for the reaction is:

                                          NaOH(aq) + NHzSO3H(aq) + NH,SO3Na(aq) + HzO(1)
                                   You may be shown a shorter method than the following one, but this method, using moles, is more
                                   versatile and can be used in more difficult examples.
                                   Step 1: calculate the amount of one substance, in this case the sulfamic acid.
                                          n(NH,SO3H) = c x V = 0.0985 x aS = 0.00223 mol
                                   Step 2: calculate the amount of the other substance using the reacting ratio in the equation.
                                   As the reacting ratio is     1: 1, n(NaOH) = 0.00223 mol
                                   Step 3: calculate the concentration of sodium hydroxide solution.

WORKED EXAMPLE 2
A titration is done to calculate the concentration of a solution of nitric acid, using a standard solution of
sodium carbonate. The equation for the reaction is:



The titration results are:
volume of sodium carbonate solution used                 = 25.0cm?
volume of nitric acid solution used                      = 27.25cm?
concentration of sodium carbonate solution               =0.108moldm=

Step 1: calculate the amount of sodium carbonate.

       n=: 0.108 x =
                   aie= 0.00270 mol
Step 2: calculate the amount of the other substance using the reacting ratio in the equation (1:2 in
        this example).
       n = 0.00270 x 2 = 0.00540 mol

Step 3: calculate the concentration of the nitric acid.

       - - 0.00540
                         = 0.198 moldm=>

WORKED EXAMPLE 3
A titration is done to calculate the concentration of a solution of hydrochloric acid, using the sodium
hydroxide solution from Worked example 1. The equation for the reaction is:

       NaOH + HCI — NaCl + H,O

The titration results are:
volume of sodium hydroxide solution used             =   === 25.0cm*
volume of hydrochloric acid used                         = 22.68cm?
concentration of sodium hydroxide solution               = 0.0892 moldm-?
This time, we will use the shorter method of calculation, using the expression
              My           M>
       V; x a = V; x >

where V is the volume, M is the molar concentration and n is the coefficient in the equation. The subscript
1 refers to the first substance in the equation, and the subscript 2 to the second substance.

In this example, the unknown is M>, so rearranging the expression and substituting the values gives             LEARNING TIP
the answer.                                                                                                     Practise the calculation method.

                               USING THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY
                               In science, it is sometimes difficult to find the correct words to use when considering the results of
                               experiments and the calculations based on these results. This is because in the non-scientific world,
                               words are often used with less care. You have already seen the idea that ‘amount’ has a specific
                               meaning in chemistry (amount of substance, in moles) and should not be used to refer to mass
                               or volume.

                               We will look at terminology in this topic.
                                ¢   Mistakes and errors are not the same thing.
                                ¢   Accuracy and precision have different meanings.
                                ¢   Systematic errors and random errors have different causes.

                               Here, we look at the differences in meaning between some of the more important terms.

                               To do this, we will refer back to previous sections in Topic 8D, which involve measuring masses and
                               volumes using different methods and apparatus.


                               MISTAKES ARE NOT ERRORS
                               Put very simply, an error is something that even a skilled operator would find difficult to avoid, and is a
                               consequence of the way the apparatus has been constructed and how readings can be made using it.

                               A mistake is something that a skilled operator can avoid by being careful.

                               Here are some examples of mistakes.
                                1    Achemist weighs a beaker on a balance without making sure the balance is tared (set to zero)
                                     beforehand. The reading on the balance could be very different from the actual mass of the
                                     beaker, so the reading should not be used, although this careless chemist may not realise this.

                               2     Astudent sees a burette reading of 27.35 cm? but writes it down as 23.75 cm’. This is the
                                     student’s mistake, and has nothing to do with the apparatus.
                               3     A student fills a burette using a funnel and forgets to remove the funnel before adding the liquid
                                     to the flask. During the addition, some of the liquid in the funnel drips into the burette, and this
                                     causes an incorrect burette reading to be recorded. This is due to the student’s faulty technique.
                                     Again, it has nothing to do with the actual apparatus, only his careless use of it.

                               ACCURACY AND PRECISION, AND SYSTEMATIC AND RANDOM ERRORS
                               The most important terms to consider are:
                                *   error

                                *   accuracy

                                *   precision.

                               The last two terms are often confused. We will try to understand the difference between them by
                               considering some burette readings and an archery competition.

                               A teacher and some students doa titration using the same solutions. The teacher works carefully and
                               obtains a mean titre of 24.27 cm’, which we will assume is the ‘correct’ value.

All the mean titres have been calculated correctly.

Now for the archery competition. The aim of an archery competition is to win by managing to land
all the arrows as close as possible to the centre of the target. These diagrams show how well the three
students have done at archery using their titre values.

 A               Student A has titres that are all concordant (within 0.10 cm? of each other), but the mean
                 is 0.57 cm? higher than the correct value. This suggests that the titrations have been
                 carefully carried out, but that there is probably something about the apparatus that is
                 responsible for the large difference from the correct titre value. This is called a systematic
                 error. The titre values are precise but not accurate.

 B               Student B has no concordant titres (they are very different from each other) but the
                 mean is within 0.07 cm? of the correct value. This suggests that the titrations have been
                 carelessly done, but the student has been lucky because the mean happens to be close
                 to the correct value. This is called a random error. Even though each individual titre is           LEARNING TIP

                                 PERCENTAGE MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES
                                 Each piece of apparatus you use to record a value (such as mass, volume, temperature or time) has
                                 a measurement uncertainty associated with it, which depends on the way it has been manufactured
                                 and calibrated.

                                 The actual measurement uncertainty may be fixed. However, in many cases the percentage uncertainty
                                 when you use the apparatus depends on the value you measure. This mostly depends on whether you
                                 use the apparatus to record only one value or two values, and on how big the value is compared to the
                                 capacity of the apparatus.

                                 BALANCES
                                 The percentage uncertainty in using a balance depends on:
                                 ¢     the precision of the balance, i.e. the number of decimal places to which the balance can be read
                                 ¢     the mass being weighed, as the percentage uncertainty will be greater for a smaller mass.

                                     WORKED EXAMPLE 1

                                     The measurement uncertainty in a two-decimal place balance is +0.005 g. We have to count this
                                     uncertainty twice. This is because there is a +0.005 g uncertainty when calibrating the balance to zero, as
                                     well as a 0.005 g uncertainty when measuring the mass.
                                     So the percentage uncertainty is:

                                               ae x 0.005 x 100

The percentage uncertainty is greater in Worked example 2,
even though the balance reads to one more decimal place. This
is because the balance is used twice and also because the mass
being weighed is much smaller.

ADDING MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES
If a final answer has been obtained using more than one piece of
apparatus, then the approximate total measurement uncertainty is
obtained by adding together the individual uncertainties.

NUTS ABOUT SELENIUM
Selenium is an essential dietary element in trace quantities, but it can be toxic in higher concentrations. The extract below describes one
technique used to reduce discharge of selenium salts into the San Francisco Bay, USA.

DID YOU KNOW?
Brazil nuts are a particularly rich source of selenium, but
don’t go overboard! Too much selenium in the diet can cause
the body to break down and excrete excess selenium in the
form of gaseous hydrogen selenide (H,Se). This can leave the
unwitting consumer of too many brazil nuts breathing out an
odour not unlike garlic.

TOPIC 9 INTRODUCTION TO
KINETICS AND EQUILIBRIA

Reaction kinetics is the study of rates of reactions. Some reactions in everyday life take place very quickly, while other
reactions are very slow. The combustion of petrol in the engine of a racing car is very rapid and allows the car to travel at
very fast speeds. The formation of stalactites and stalagmites by the decomposition of dissolved calcium
hydrogencarbonate into solid calcium carbonate is very slow. It has taken hundreds of years for these to form in
limestone caves, such as the one shown from central Saudi Arabia. Some types of food are kept in a refrigerator ora
freezer to slow down the rate at which they go bad.

Haemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen around the body. Each haemoglobin
molecule attaches to four oxygen molecules in a reversible reaction:

     Hb(aq) + 40,(g) = Hb(O,), (aq)
where ‘Hb’ stands for haemoglobin.
As long as there is sufficient oxygen in the air, a healthy equilibrium is maintained. However, at high altitudes, changes
occur. The concentration of oxygen is lowered and this produces a shift in equilibrium to the left.
Without an adequate oxygen supply to the body's cells and tissues, you may feel light-headed. If you are not physically
prepared for the change, you may need to breathe pressurised oxygen from an oxygen tank. This shifts the equilibrium to
the right. For people born and raised at high altitudes, however, the body's chemistry performs the equilibrium shift to
the right by producing more haemoglobin.
If you are exposed to carbon monoxide, it bonds to haemoglobin in preference to oxygen and sets up the following
reversible reaction:

     Hb(aq) + 4CO(g) = Hb(CO),(aq)
Carboxyhaemoglobin is formed, which is even redder than haemoglobin, so one sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is a
flushed face.

Carbon monoxide in small quantities can cause headaches and dizziness, but larger concentrations can be fatal. To
reverse the effects of the carbon monoxide, pure oxygen must be introduced to the body. It will react with the
carboxyhaemoglobin to produce oxygenated haemoglobin, along with carbon monoxide:

      Hb(CO),(aq) + 40,(g) = Hb(O,),(aq) + 4CO(g)
The gaseous carbon monoxide thus produced is removed from the body when the person exhales.

RATE OF REACTION                                                                 Sometimes it is more convenient to measure the concentration of

We can determine the rate of a chemical reaction by the change
in concentration of a reactant or a product per unit time.                       The graph in fig B shows a plot of concentration against time,

                PRESSURE AND SURFACE AREA
                ON RATE OF REACTION

 TM Understand, in terms of the collision theory, the effect of changes in concentration of solution, pressure of a gas
     and surface area of a solid on the rate of a chemical reaction.

According to the collision theory, reactant particles have to collide with sufficient energy before they
can react. It is sensible, therefore, to suggest that we can increase the rate of a reaction by increasing
the frequency of collisions with sufficient energy between reactant particles. This is often true, but
as in SO many situations in chemistry, there are exceptions. You will learn about these in Topic 11
(Book 2: IAL).

Collisions that result in a reaction are called successful collisions.


THE EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION
For reactions in solution, an increase in concentration often causes an increase in reaction rate.
For many reactions, if the concentration of a solution is increased, then the frequency of collisions
between reacting solute particles also increases. This is because they are closer together as there are
more of them in a volume of solution. The frequency of successful collisions increases (i.e. there are
more successful collisions per second), which in turn produces an increase in the rate of reaction.

The graph in fig A shows the effect of the change in volume of carbon dioxide given off with time
for the reaction between calcium carbonate and excess dilute hydrochloric acid.

    for the reaction between calcium carbonate and excess dilute hydrochloric acid.


Curve A represents the higher concentration of acid. You will notice that the gradient of curve A is
always greater than the gradient of curve B. You will also notice that curve A levels off before curve B.
Both factors indicate that the rate of reaction is greater for the higher concentration of acid.


THE EFFECT OF PRESSURE
For a reaction in which molecules collide and react in the gas phase, an increase in pressure will
cause an increase in the rate of reaction.

The explanation is similar to that for concentration of solution. If the pressure of the gaseous
mixture is increased, there will be more reactant molecules in a given volume of mixture. The
frequency of collisions will increase. This will result in an increase in the rate of reaction.

Changing the pressure has almost no effect on reactions in the solid or liquid phase. This is because
the volume of solids and liquids changes very little when they are put under pressure, so their
particles do not move closer together.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M Know that many reactions are readily reversible.
®@ Know that reversible reactions can reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in which:
   (i)    both forward and backward reactions are still occurring
   (ii)   the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction
   (iii) the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant.


                                IRREVERSIBLE AND REVERSIBLE REACTIONS
                                When a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 molar ratio is ignited, water is produced. There is
                                very little, if any, uncombined hydrogen or oxygen remaining at the end of the reaction. We often
                                describe such reactions as ‘irreversible’.

                                Most combustion reactions are in this category since they are highly exothermic. That is, AH is
                                large and negative. However, AH is small for many reactions, especially in organic chemistry. These
                                reactions may not go to completion. At the end of the reaction, detectable amounts of the reactants
                                remain, mixed with the product. These reactions are called ‘reversible’ reactions.


                                HOW TO DECIDE WHETHER A REACTION IS REVERSIBLE
                                Deciding whether a reaction is reversible or not depends on how carefully we measure the
                                concentrations of reactants and products. For example, the reaction between dilute hydrochloric
                                acid and aqueous sodium hydroxide appears to go to completion. Both acid and alkali are almost
                                completely ionised in water, so the equation for the reaction is:

                                      H"(aq) + OH (aq) > H,0())
                                Pure water has a slight electrical conductivity. This results from the ionisation of water molecules:

                                      H,O(1) + H*(aq) + OH (aq)
                                This indicates that the reverse reaction is taking place to a small extent. Since only one molecule in
                                approximately 550 million is ionised, we usually ignore this small extent of ionisation. However, it
                                becomes important when we study the pH scale of acidity.

                                In practical terms, if a reaction is more than 99% complete, we usually consider it to have gone to
                                completion.


                                THE REACTION BETWEEN HYDROGEN AND IODINE
                                If a mixture of hydrogen and iodine vapour in a 1:1 molar ratio is heated to 573 K in a closed
                                container, about 90% of the hydrogen and iodine react to form hydrogen iodide. Provided the
                                reaction mixture remains in the closed container at 573 K, 10% of the hydrogen and iodine will
                                remain unreacted even if you leave the reaction mixture for a long time.

                                If a sample of hydrogen iodide is heated to 573K    in a closed container, it partially decomposes.
                                The mixture formed is identical to that produced when starting with an equimolar mixture of
                                hydrogen and iodine. The reaction is clearly reversible, and when there is no further change in the
                                concentrations of the reactants and products, the system is said to be in ‘equilibrium’.

                                The symbol = is used in an equation to represent a reversible reaction. The equation for the reaction
                                between hydrogen and iodine is therefore written as follows:

                                      H,(g) + 1,(g) = 2HI(g)
                                When the equation is written in this way, the reaction between hydrogen and iodine is called the forward
                                reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen iodide into hydrogen and iodine is called the backward reaction.

HOW IS EQUILIBRIUM ESTABLISHED?
When the mixture of hydrogen and iodine is heated, the two gases start to react and form hydrogen
iodide. With increasing time, the concentrations of hydrogen and iodine decrease, so the rate of the
forward reaction decreases.

As soon as some hydrogen iodide is formed, it starts to slowly decompose. With increasing time,
however, the concentration of hydrogen iodide increases, so the rate of the backward reaction
increases.

Eventually, the rates of the forward and the backward reactions become equal. After this point there
is no further change in concentrations of reactants and products. The system is now in equilibrium.
It is referred to as a ‘dynamic’ equilibrium since both forward and backward reactions are taking
place at the same time, and also at the same rate.

Two conditions must be met for dynamic equilibrium to be established:

1    the reaction must be reversible

2    the reaction mixture must be in a closed container

Three important features define a system that is in dynamic equilibrium:

¢    Both forward and backward reactions are continuously occurring.

e The rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction.                            LEARNING TIP

                                  CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF AN EQUILIBRIUM MIXTURE
                                  Whena reaction mixture reaches a position of equilibrium, the composition of the equilibrium
                                  mixture (i.e. the concentration of each component) will not alter as long as the conditions remain
                                  the same.

                                  However, if we change a condition (i.e. add some more of, or remove one of, the components, or
                                  change the temperature of the system) then the composition may change. This is often referred to
                                  as ‘changing the position of equilibrium’, and we refer to the position being moved to the right, to the
                                  left or not changed.

                                  For example, if acid is added to a yellow solution containing chromate(VI) ions, CrO;, the solution
                                  turns orange. This is because of an increase in the amount of dichromate(VI) ions, Cr,O#".

                                  The equilibrium position moves to the right when the acid (H"*) is added. If sufficient alkali is added
                                  to the orange solution, it will turn yellow as the amount of CrO{ ions increases and exceeds the
                                  amount of Cr,O0#~ ions. The equilibrium position moves to the left when alkali (OH) is added.

                                  We will consider four factors that may affect the position of equilibrium of a reaction mixture.
                                  These are:

                                  1   concentration of a component

                                  2   pressure of the system

                                  3   temperature of the system

                                  EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONCENTRATION
                                  If we increase the concentration of one of the reactants in a system in equilibrium, the rate of
                                  the forward reaction will increase and more products will form. As the concentration of the
                                  products increases, the rate of the backward reaction increases and eventually a new equilibrium is
                                  established. The equilibrium position has moved to the right, with slightly more product being present
                                  than at the original position of equilibrium.

If the concentration of one of the reactants is decreased, the position of equilibrium moves to the left.
Similar changes occur if the concentration of the product is increased or decreased.

The changes that occur are summarised in the table A.

EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN PRESSURE
The effect of pressure only applies to reversible reactions involving gases. At a given temperature,
the pressure of a gaseous mixture depends only on the number of gas molecules in a given volume.
So, the pressure of a gaseous mixture may be increased by reducing the volume and reduced by
increasing the volume.

Alternatively, the pressure at which the reaction is carried out can be:

e    increased by initially using more moles of the reactants in the same volume

e    decreased by using fewer moles of the reactants in the same volume.

The effect of a change in pressure (at constant temperature) caused by changing the volume of the
reaction mixture can be studied using a gas syringe and pushing in, or pulling out, the plunger The
effect depends on the total number of moles of gas on each side of the balanced equation, and is
summarised in table B.

The reverse changes are true for a decrease in pressure.

volume container is shown in fig B. The reaction is between nitrogen and hydrogen, forming ammonia.

                                     The equation for the reaction is:

                                     N,(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH;(g)
                                     In the balanced equation, there are 4 moles of gas on the left-hand side and 2 moles of gas on the
                                     right-hand side.

                                     The graph in fig B shows that the higher the pressure, the more ammonia there is in the equilibrium

                                     increase in rate will be the same for both reactions. So, the position of equilibrium is not altered.

                                     The advantage of adding a catalyst at the beginning of the reaction is that it will reduce the time
                                     required to establish equilibrium.


                                     LIMITATIONS OF MAKING QUALITATIVE PREDICTIONS
                                     The first thing to recognise is that the qualitative predictions we have made about the effect of
                                     concentration, pressure and temperature on the position of equilibrium are just that — predictions.

                                     The arguments we have used are not explanations of why changes sometimes occur. In fact, there
                                     are occasions when it is impossible to predict the direction of change, or indeed when the prediction
                                     turns out to be incorrect.

                                     For example, if an equilibrium mixture of NO,(g) (brown) and N,O,(g) (colourless) in a closed
                                     container is placed into a beaker of hot water at room temperature, both the temperature and the
                                     pressure of the gaseous mixture will rise.

                                     The equation for the reaction is:

                                            2NO.(g) = N,O,(g)                   AH= -57.2kJmol!"!

                                     Because the forward reaction is exothermic, we would predict that an increase in temperature would
                                     shift the equilibrium to the left.

                                     However, since there are fewer moles of gas on the right-hand side of the equation, we would predict
                                     that an increase in pressure would shift the equilibrium to the right.

                                     We do not know which effect is greater, so we cannot make a prediction of which way the
                                     equilibrium will shift. In practice, the mixture becomes darker in colour, so the temperature effect
                                     must be greater than the pressure effect.This is because the equilibrium must have shifted to the left
                                     to produce more brown NO.(g).

It might be interesting for you to do further research into the limitations of qualitative predictions.
For example, what would you expect to happen if you add more nitrogen at constant pressure and
temperature to an equilibrium mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia? What would you expect
to happen if you added an inert gas at constant volume and temperature to an equilibrium mixture
of sulfur dioxide, oxygen and sulfur trioxide? The results may surprise you!



 DID YOU KNOW?
 A principle known as Le Chatelier’s Principle is sometimes recommended as a useful way of working
 out the possible change in position of equilibrium when a condition is altered. There is no requirement
 to learn or use this principle in this course.
 Le Chatelier’s Principle does not offer an explanation as to why a position of equilibrium alters.
 Explanations are only possible through the use of the equilibrium constant, K. This concept will be
 introduced in Topic 13 (Book 2: IAL).

                               demonstrated by considering the Haber process for the manufacture of ammonia.

                               THE HABER PROCESS
                               Ammonia is manufactured in industry by direct synthesis from nitrogen and hydrogen:

                                      N.(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH.(g)             MAH=-92kJmol"!

                               If the reaction mixture were to reach equilibrium, the maximum yield of ammonia would be obtained
                               by using a low temperature (forward reaction is exothermic) and a high pressure (4mol of gas on the
                               left; 2mol of gas on the right).

                               However, the reaction mixture does not reach a position of equilibrium in the reaction chamber. You
                               can see this by analysing the graphs in fig A.

                               The conditions used in the Haber process are typically 450°C and 250 atmospheres (atm) pressure.
                               If the reaction mixture were to reach equilibrium, then the yield of ammonia would be just over 30%.
                               In practice, the yield is approximately 15%. This is because the reaction mixture does not remain in

                               WHY ARE CONDITIONS OF 450°C AND 250 ATM USED?
                               The reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen is extremely slow at room temperature. This is mainly
                               because of the very strong nitrogen to nitrogen triple bond [E(N=N) = 945kJmol"'] producing a

  DID YOU KNOW?
  Chlorine gas is an irritant that causes serious damage to the eyes and respiratory system by reacting with water to form hydrochloric acid.
  For this reason, it was used as a chemical weapon in the First World War. The strong odour and the green colour of the gas made it easy
  to detect so more effective alternatives were soon developed. One of these was phosgene — a gas with the chemical formula COCI,. The
  gas was formed by the reaction of chlorine and carbon monoxide in the presence of light so it was named by combining the Greek ‘phos’
  (meaning light) and ‘genesis’ (meaning birth). Since 1925, over 190 states have signed up to the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use
  of chemical and biological weapons.

In Topics 4 and 5, you learned about the basics of organic chemistry and about two homologous series,
alkanes and alkenes. In this topic, you will learn about two more homologous series, halogenoalkanes and
alcohols. There is also a new reaction mechanism to consider, nucleophilic substitution.
Although you have already learned something about mass spectrometry, we will build on this knowledge to
see how the technique was developed to becomea useful tool to discover the structures of organic
compounds. A new technique, infrared spectroscopy, is introduced to show another way to discover different
information about the structures of organic compounds.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Understand the nomenclature of halogenoalkanes and be able to draw their structural, displayed
    and skeletal formulae.
M@ Understand the distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary halogenoalkanes.
M Know the definition of the term ‘nucleophile’.


                                  WHAT ARE HALOGENOALKANES?
                                  The halogenoalkanes are a homologous series of compounds with the general formula C,,H2,.+;X.
                                  Think of them as the result of replacing a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by a halogen atom.
                                  X represents a halogen atom — usually bromine or chlorine, but it could also be fluorine or iodine.
                                  You have already met halogenoalkanes earlier in this book — chloromethane is a halogenoalkane and
                                  is the product of the reaction between methane and chlorine.

                                  The symbol R is often used in organic chemistry to represent any alkyl group (such as methyl or
                                  ethyl). The formula of a halogenoalkane could be simplified to RX.

                                  The number of halogen atoms in a halogenoalkane molecule can be more than one, so the general
                                  formula is different for these compounds (for example, C,,H,,X, and C,,H2,-;X; are other possible
                                  general formulae).




                                        fig A The most problematic halogenoalkanes are those containing both chlorine and fluorine. They are known as
                                        chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs for short) and were used in aerosol cans for decades. We have known for a long time
                                        that they damage the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere and, through international agreement, they are mostly
                                        no longer used.

                                  We have already met the names of some halogenoalkanes, but table A shows some examples to

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES

M@ Understand that experimental observations and data can be used to compare the relative rates of hydrolysis
     of primary, secondary and tertiary structural isomers of a halogenoalkane, and primary chloro-, bromo- and iodo-
     alkanes, using aqueous silver nitrate in ethanol.
M@ Know the trend in reactivity of primary, secondary and tertiary halogenoalkanes.
M@ Understand, in terms of bond enthalpy, the trend in reactivity of chloro-, bromo- and iodo-alkanes.


                                           PRACTICAL ASPECTS
                                           If instead of adding water in a hydrolysis reaction, silver nitrate solution is added, then the progress
                                           of the reaction can be followed. You may remember that silver nitrate can be used in a test for halide
                                           ions because the silver ions in silver nitrate react with the halide ions formed in the hydrolysis to give
                                           a precipitate:

                                                   Ag* +X” — Agx

                                           This means that we can tell how quickly the hydrolysis reaction occurs by observing how quickly the
                                           precipitate of AgX forms.

                                           Without going into full practical details, a comparison of the rates of these reactions involves:

                                           e using ethanol as a solvent for the mixture (halogenoalkanes and aqueous silver nitrate do not mix,
                                                but form separate layers)
                                           e controlling variables such as temperature and the concentration and quantity of halogenoalkanes
                                           e    timing the appearance of the precipitate (although this is difficult to do accurately because a
                                                precipitate may first appear faint, but become thicker with time).

                                           In an experiment, three tubes containing silver nitrate dissolved in ethanol are left at the same
                                           temperature for several minutes. Each tube contains a different halogenoalkane. Fig A shows the
                                           tubes after several minutes.

                                           Fig A shows that there is no precipitate in tube (a), a faint cream-coloured precipitate in tube (b)
                                           and a thicker pale yellow precipitate in tube (c). These observations are caused by the reaction of a
                                           chloroalkane in (a), a bromoalkane in (b) and an iodoalkane in (c).

                                           Two types of comparison can be made. You can:

                                           e compare halogenoalkanes with the same structure but containing different halogens
                                           e    compare halogenoalkanes containing the same halogen but with different structures.

                                           Fluoroalkanes are comparatively very unreactive, so reactions involving them are often omitted.

                                           You might suppose that the halogenoalkane with the most polar bond would be the fastest to be
                                           hydrolysed (in this case, 1-chlorobutane) because the 6+ charge on the carbon atom is greatest, so
                                           the attacking nucleophile should be attracted more strongly.

This is true, but there is another, more important factor to consider Bond breaking requires energy,
and weaker bonds break more easily than stronger bonds. Table B shows (mean) bond enthalpies.
You can see that the C—I bond is the weakest and the C—Cl bond is the strongest.

 BOND      | BOND ENTHALPY / kJ mot'
 C-—Cl      +346
 C—Br       +290

 C-|        +228

table B Mean bond enthalpies.

Under the same conditions, the C—I bond breaks most easily, forming I” ions, and so a precipitate of
Agl forms more quickly.

The C—F bond is much stronger (+467
                                kJ mol’) than any of the others, which explains why
fluoroalkanes are not often used in these hydrolysis experiments.


INTERPRETING THE RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT STRUCTURES
Table C shows the trend when the structure is different.

table C Examples comparing halogenoalkanes with the same halogen but with different structures.

‘To explain why tertiary halogenoalkanes are more rapidly hydrolysed than secondary and primary
compounds requires a detailed understanding of two different reaction mechanisms, and is beyond
the scope of this book, but will be dealt with in Topic 15A (Book 2: IAL).


 LEARNING TIP
 Molecules with partial charges (6+ and 5-) are not ions. They are molecules with no overall charge but with
 electron-rich and electron-deficient parts.



 CHECKPOINT
 1. 2-bromopropane and 2-iodopropane are put into separate test tubes and warmed with water. Explain
    which one is hydrolysed more quickly.

 2. Why are fluoroalkanes not readily hydrolysed compared with chloroalkanes?

Reaction 2 above is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, but
using a different solvent (ethanol instead of water) causes a
different reaction to occur. When a halogenoalkane is heated with
ethanolic potassium hydroxide, the OH ion acts as a base and
not as a nucleophile. You know that a base reacts with a hydrogen
ion (H*), but in the case of a halogenoalkane, the hydrogen that
reacts with the OHTM ion is the one attached to a carbon atom next
to the C in the C—Br bond.

                                          WHAT ARE ALCOHOLS?
                                          The alcohols are a homologous series of compounds with the general formula C,H,,,,,OH. Think of
                                          them as the result of replacing a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group. You have
                                          already met alcohols in Topic 10B.1 as the products of the hydrolysis of halogenoalkanes.

                                          The symbol R can be used to represent an alkyl group, as with halogenoalkanes. The formula of an
                                          alcohol can be simplified to ROH.

                                          and to halogenoalkanes (in Topic 10B.1).

                                          Alcohols are classified in a similar way, depending on the number of alkyl groups joined to the C
                                          atom bonded to the hydroxy! group. Table B shows some examples.

alcohol is slowly added to the oxidising agent. When the aldehyde
is formed, it immediately distils off (it has a much lower boiling
temperature than the alcohol used to make it), and is collected in
the receiver.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

lM Know when and how to use the following techniques in the preparation and purification of a liquid organic
   compound: simple distillation, fractional distillation, solvent extraction, drying, and boiling temperature determination.


                               BACKGROUND
                               So far, you have met many different reactions that can be used in the preparation of organic
                               compounds. In most cases the intended organic product is not pure. It could be contaminated with:

                               e unreacted starting materials
                               e   other organic products
                               e   the inorganic reagents used, or the inorganic products formed from them

                               e   water.

                               This means that organic chemists need to use several techniques to separate the intended product
                               from a reaction mixture. These techniques will be different, depending on whether the intended
                               product is a gas, a liquid or a solid. In this topic, we consider only the techniques used to purify an
                               organic liquid.

                               The techniques we consider are:

                               e   simple distillation
                               e   fractional distillation

                               e   solvent extraction
                               e   drying

                               In a chemistry textbook, you will see many different diagrams of apparatus used in organic
                               chemistry. You will have some of these pieces of apparatus in your laboratory, but you will probably
                               not be able to set up every piece of apparatus you see in the book.

                               In simple laboratory experiments not involving organic compounds, you are likely to use pieces of
                               glassware connected by tubing and corks or bungs. This kind of apparatus is relatively inexpensive
                               to buy and easy to use. If one of the gases you are using, such as carbon dioxide, leaks from the
                               apparatus, this is not a major problem.

                               Organic compounds are more of a problem because they may be flammable, or toxic, or both. They
                               may also attack corks and bungs, and so increase the risk of leaks and contamination. One solution
                               to these problems is to use a type of apparatus made only (or mostly) of glass, and which can be
                               fitted together tightly using ground-glass joints.

SIMPLE DISTILLATION
Here is a summary of the process of simple distillation.

¢    Distillation of an impure liquid involves heating the liquid in a flask connected to a condenser

¢    The liquid with the lowest boiling temperature evaporates or boils off first and passes into the
      condenser first. This means it can be collected in the receiver separately from any other liquid that
     evaporates later.

¢    The purpose of the thermometer is to monitor the temperature of the vapour as it passes into the
     condenser. If the temperature remains steady, this is an indication that one compound is distilling
     over. If, after a while, the temperature begins to rise, this indicates that a different compound is
     beginning to distil over.

Fig C shows the apparatus used for simple distillation.

TESTING FOR PURITY
Using one or more of the purifying techniques, you have purified an organic compound. But is it
really pure?

For liquids, there is a simple way to test whether it is pure — measure its boiling temperature.
Impurities raise the boiling temperature.

The boiling temperatures of pure organic compounds have been carefully measured and are
widely available in data books and online. If you measure the boiling temperature of your organic
compound, you can compare it with an accurate value and then make your decision about how
pure it is.

The apparatus used depends on the volume of liquid available, and whether it is toxic or flammable.
The apparatus used for simple distillation can be used.

A word of caution — this test may not be conclusive, because you may not be able to measure the
boiling temperature of your organic compound accurately enough. Your thermometer might read too
low or too high, so even if your measured boiling temperature exactly matches the one in the data
book or online, you may wrongly assume that your compound is pure.

Also remember that different organic compounds can, by coincidence, have the same boiling
temperature. For example, both 1-chloropentane and 2-methylpropan-1-ol boil at 108°C.


    LEARNING TIP

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

MTM@ Be able to interpret data from mass spectra to suggest possible structures of simple organic compounds.


                              BACKGROUND TO MASS SPECTROMETRY
                              You have already come across the principles of mass spectrometry in Topic 2A.2. We will now look
                              at how this technique can be used to determine the relative molecular mass of organic compounds.
                              We will also determine the structures of some of these compounds.

                              The mass spectrum of an element often appears very simple, with a very small number of vertical
                              lines, called peaks. Each peak represents an isotope of the element.

                              In contrast, the mass spectrum of an organic compound often appears complex, with many peaks.
                              If all the peaks are included, there may be more peaks than there are atoms in a molecule of the
                              compound, so something different is happening.

                              THE MOLECULAR ION PEAK
                              The obvious thing to do when first looking at the mass spectrum of an organic compound is to find
                              the peak furthest to the right. This is the one with the greatest m/z value (mass to charge ratio). This
                              peak is the molecular ion peak — the result of the organic molecule losing an electron in the mass
                              spectrometer. The equation for this process, using butane as an example, is:

                                     CaHip +e — C,H + 2e-

                              An electron collides with a butane molecule and knocks out an electron, so forming a positive ion
                              from the molecule. The m/z value of the C,H;j peak (58) indicates the relative molecular mass of
                              butane.

                              OTHER PEAKS
                              The spectrum may showa very small peak just to the right of the molecular ion peak (sometimes
                              referred to as the M+1 peak). This is caused by the presence of a naturally occurring isotope of
                              carbon ('%C, rather than the usual '*C isotope) in the molecule. Approximately 99% of all carbon
                              atoms are 7C, with most of the remaining 1% being °C.

                              You may have met the 4C isotope, which also occurs naturally in organic compounds. This isotope is
                              radioactive and used in radiocarbon dating. The proportion of '*C atoms in a sample of an organic
                              compound is extremely small and can be ignored in mass spectrometry.

                              The peaks with smaller m/z values result from fragmentation in the mass spectrometer,
                              rearrangement reactions and the loss of more than one electron. Rearrangement is often
                              unpredictable and will not be considered here, but it does help to explain the large number of peaks
                              in some spectra. The breaking of a carbon—hydrogen bond can occur, but this is not usually described
                              as fragmentation.


                              FRAGMENTATION IN HYDROCARBONS
                              Fragmentation is very common and can often be used to work out the structure of an organic
                              molecule.

                              Consider the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in the molecular ion formed from a hydrocarbon.
                              Two species are formed. They are:

EXAMPLES OF FRAGMENTATION                                               The tallest peak is sometimes referred to as the base peak.

A very simple example of fragmentation is the molecular ion of          This base peak represents the ion with the highest abundance, and
ethane, which can fragment to form a methyl cation and a methyl         is shown with a relative intensity of 100%. It represents the most

The ethane molecule is symmetrical, and there is only one                       100 -                                              iv

A TYPICAL MASS SPECTRUM
The traditional way to present a mass spectrum is to label the
vertical axis as relative intensity (%), always from 0% to 100%. The
horizontal axis is labelled m/z (with no units). The horizontal axis
usually, but not necessarily, starts from zero and continues to just
beyond the molecular ion peak.

                             FRAGMENTATION IN OTHER ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
                             So far, we have looked only at the mass spectra of alkanes. Now let’s look at other organic
                             compounds — those containing oxygen.

                             In this topic, we will look at two examples of simplified mass spectra and see how they can be used
                             to work out the structures of the compounds responsible for them.

                             Oxygen is present in many organic compounds, so you need to be familiar with other m/z values. You
                             may also come across compounds containing nitrogen (amines) and halogens (halogenoalkanes).

                             Table A shows some common m/z values and possible ions responsible for these peaks.

                              LEARNING TIP
                              It is sometimes worth comparing the m/z values of fragment ions with that of the molecular ion. The
                              difference between the two indicates what has been lost during fragmentation.
                              For example, if the molecular ion peak is at m/z = 60 and there is a fragment ion with m/z = 45, the
                              difference is 15, which suggests the loss of a CH; group.

                              INFRARED RADIATION
                              The electromagnetic spectrum of radiation shown in fig A includes infrared radiation. The ‘infra’
                              part of ‘infrared’ comes from the Latin for ‘below’, so this radiation has a frequency below, or less
                              than, that of red light.

                              WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MOLECULES ABSORB INFRARED RADIATION
                              The importance of infrared radiation in chemistry is that it is absorbed by molecules and causes two
                              possible effects, both described as vibrations. These effects are:
                              e   stretching — where the bond length increases and decreases

                              e   bending — where the bond angle increases and decreases.

                              When a molecule absorbs infrared radiation, the amount of energy absorbed depends on:

                              e   the length of the bond

                              e   the strength of the bond
                              e   the mass of each atom involved in the bond.

for the numbers to decrease from left to right, but the left to right      In the example spectrum in this topic, the strong absorption at

Fig B is an example of a typical infrared spectrum.                        Sometimes a missing absorption is just as useful. In the example,
                                                                           there is no absorption in the 3300-2500 cm“ region, so the

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

MTM@ Be able to use infrared spectra to deduce functional groups present in organic compounds.
M@ Be able to predict infrared absorptions due to familiar functional groups including wavenumber data.


                              DIFFERENT WAYS OF USING INFRARED SPECTRA
                              There are three main ways your understanding of infrared spectra could be tested, and you need to
                             become familiar with all of them. They are:

                              e    predicting the absorptions in the spectrum of an organic compound

                              e    deducing the functional groups in a compound froma list of wavenumbers
                              e    deducing the structure of a compound from wavenumbers and molecular formula.

                              These all require the use of wavenumber data, like the data shown in Topic 10D.3. This will either
                             be provided in the question, or you can use information from the Data booklet provided in the exam.
                              Table A is the table from Topic 10D.3 reproduced here for your convenience.

                              FINGERPRINT REGION
                             You may come across the term ‘fingerprint region’. This term is worth explaining. The table of
                             wavenumbers starts at 3750 and ends at 1645cmTM', even though there are many absorptions in
                             the infrared region between 1500 to 500cmTM'. Most of the absorptions in this region (1500 and
                              500cmTM') result from bending vibrations (not considered in this book) or from absorptions by bonds
                             not listed in the table of wavenumbers.

                             This region is sometimes referred to as the ‘fingerprint region’ because, although individual
                             absorptions are not easily recognised, the whole pattern acts like a fingerprint that is slightly different
                             for similar molecules.


                              PREDICTING THE SPECTRUM OF AN ORGANIC COMPOUND
                             Suppose you are given the identity of an organic compound. This might be a formula (displayed,
                             skeletal or structural) or a name. You should then be able to predict the wavenumber ranges of the
                             compound's infrared spectrum.

Answer

The functional groups are O—H (alcohol) and C=O (aldehyde).
The only structure with the molecular formula C;H,O, that fits is
CH3(OH)CHO. Note that it is not CH;,COOH (ethanoic acid) because
this would have an absorption in the range 3300-2500cm"', not at

The women’s 800 m record was set in 1983 by the Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova, who ran the distance
in 1:53.28. This was before the test for human growth hormone was in routine use at athletics
competitions. Since then, only one athlete has managed to come within a second of her record.

MATHS SKILLS
      In order to be able to develop your skills, knowledge and understanding in Chemistry, you will
      need to have developed your mathematical skills in a number of key areas. This section gives more
      explanation and examples of some key mathematical concepts you need to understand. Further
      examples relevant to your IAS / IAL Chemistry studies are given throughout the book.


      ARITHMETIC AND NUMERICAL COMPUTATION
      USING STANDARD FORM
      Dealing with very large or small numbers can be difficult. For example, Avogadro’s constant is an
      important value in Chemistry which is approximately equal to 602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 mo!"’.
      To make such numbers easier to handle, we can write them in the format a x 10°. This is called
      standard form. Using standard form, Avogadro’s constant can be written as 6.02 x 107? mol"!.

      To change a number from decimal form to standard form:

      Count the number of positions you need to move the decimal point by until it is directly to the right
      of the first number that is not zero.

      This number is the index number that tells you how many multiples of 10 you need. If the original
      number was a decimal, your index number must be negative.

      Here are some examples:

       DECIMAL NOTATION                STANDARD FORM NOTATION

       3 700 000                       3.7 x 10°

      USING RATIOS, FRACTIONS AND PERCENTAGES
      Ratios, fractions and percentages help you to express one quantity in relation to another with
      precision. Ratios compare like quantities using the same units. Fractions and percentages are
      important mathematical tools for calculating proportions.

      RATIOS
      A ratio is used to compare quantities. You can simplify ratios by dividing each side by a common
      factor. For example, 12: 4 can be simplified to 3: 1 by dividing each side by 4.

       WORKED EXAMPLE
       Divide 180 into the ratio 3:2
       Answer
       Our strategy is to work out the total number of parts. Then divide 180 by the number of parts to find the
       value of one part.

              Total number of parts = 3+2=5

              Value of one part = 180 + 5 = 36

              Answer
                   = 3 x 36:2 x 36 = 108:72

       Check your answer by making sure the parts add up to 180
       108 + 72 = 180

 An excess of magnesium is added to 0.2 dm? of 1 mol dm-? dilute hydrochloric acid. The equation for the
 reaction Is:



 How many moles of hydrogen are formed?

 Since there is an excess of magnesium, we know that all of the hydrochloric acid will react. We can use
 the following equation to calculate the number of moles of hydrochloric acid:

                                               0.2 dm3
             amount of HCI reacted = 0.2 mol

 The ratio for HCI: H, in this reaction is 2: 1, so when two moles of HCI react, one mole of H, is formed.

        number of moles of H; formed = 0.5 x number of moles of HCl reacted

                                        = 0.5 x 0.2 mol

                                        = 0.1 mol

FRACTIONS

When using fractions, make sure you know the key strategies for the four operators:

To add or subtract fractions, find the lowest common multiple (LCM) and then use the golden
rule of fractions. The golden rule states that a fraction remains unchanged if the numerator and
denominator are multiplied or divided by the same number.

 WORKED EXAMPLE



To multiply fractions together, simply multiply the numerators together and multiply the
denominators together.

To divide fractions, simply invert (flip) the second fraction and multiply.

PERCENTAGES

When using percentages, it is useful to recall the different types of percentage questions.

To increase a value by a given percentage, use a percentage multiplier.


 WORKED EXAMPLE
 Increase 30 mg by 23%.

 If we increase by 23%, our new value will be 123% of the original value. We therefore multiply by 1.23.

Answer = 30 x 1.23 = 36.9mg


To decrease a value by a given percentage, you need to focus on the part that is left over after the
decrease.


 WORKED EXAMPLE
 Decrease 30 mg by 23%.

 If we decrease by 23%, our new value will be 100 - 23 = 77% of the original value. We therefore multiply
 by 0.77.
Answer = 30 x 0.77 = 23.1 mg

                     To calculate a percentage increase, use the following equation:

                                                      difference between values x 100
                              Percentage change =             —
                                                            original value

                     To calculate percentage decrease, use the same equation but remember that your answer should
                     be negative.


                         WORKED EXAMPLE
                         The volume of a solution increased from 40 ml to 50 ml. Calculate the percentage increase.

                               Change in volume = 10 ml

                               Percentage increase = = x 100 = 25%.


                     ALGEBRA
                     CHANGING THE SUBJECT OF AN EQUATION
                     It can be very helpful to rearrange an equation to express the variable that interests you, in terms of
                     other variables. Always remember that any operation that you apply to one side of the equation must
                     also be applied to the other side.

                         WORKED EXAMPLE
                     A sample of 2.5 mol of a substance has a mass of 12.5 g.
                         What is the molar mass of the substance?

                         The equation for calculating moles is n = re, where m = mass in grams, M = molar mass and n = amount of
                         substance in moles.
                         If we wished to rearrange this equation to make M the subject, we would first multiply each side by M to
                         obtain:
                               nM =m

                         Now to obtain the formula in terms of M, we divide each side by n to obtain:

                               Mg
                         We can now simply substitute in the values for the question:

                               m=12.5¢g

                     USING SIGNIFICANT FIGURES
                     Often when you do a calculation, your answer will have many more figures than you need. Using an
                     appropriate number of significant figures will help you to interpret results in a meaningful way.

                     Remember the ‘rules’ for significant figures:

                     1     The first significant figure is the first figure which is not zero.

                     2     Digits 1-9 are always significant.

                     3     Zeros that come after the first significant figure are significant unless the number has already been
                           rounded.

APPLYING YOUR SKILLS
You will often find that you need to use more than one maths technique to answer a question. In this
section, we will look at three example questions and consider which maths skills are required and
how to apply them.

WORKED EXAMPLE
 10 g of potassium was added to excess water, producing potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen
was set alight because of the exothermic nature of the reaction.
     (i) Calculate the number of moles of potassium used in the reaction.
    (ii) Calculate the number of moles of H.(g).
    (iii) Calculate the volume of H,(g) produced in dm?.

This type of question is very common. The key is to be familiar with the three different types of moles
 equations and when to use them. You will also usually have to work with ratios in order to find the correct
 number of moles of a reactant or product. This tends to be where lots of mistakes are made.
The relevance of this question to the wider world is that, as chemists, we must know how much product
we are going to make. This makes sense both for economic reasons, and in the case above where we are
 producing a highly flammable gas, for our safety as well!
 Moles equations
                            mass
    (a) moles =
                        molar mass
        This equation tends to be used when dealing with solids or masses.

    (b) moles = volume x concentration
        This equation can be used when dealing with solutions or titrations.
                        volume indm? _ volume in cm?
    (Gy male                  24           or      24000
            les     =


        This equation is used for gases.

 If you are confident with mathematics then you can also combine the above equations and rearrange
 them to solve the missing value.
                    mass
                                  = volume x concentration
                  molar mass
                    mass          _ volume indm?
                  molar mass —            24
        Using the information above:

 Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of potassium used in the reaction.

 In order to answer this question, we first need to know which equation to use. We are given a mass, and
 know we are dealing with solids, so we should use equation (a). Knowing this, it is now a simple case of
 substituting in the numerical values and solving the equation.
                         mass
       moles =
                     molar mass
                            10g
       moles =                         = 0.2558 mol
                     39.1    gmol"'!

 Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of H,(g).
 To find the number of moles of H2(g) requires us to work with ratios. First we write the chemical equation.
 Then make sure it is balanced. Sometimes this will already be done for you or it could be part of a
 previous question. Either way, balancing the chemical equation is key to determining the ratio of reactants
 to products, etc. From this, we can now determine the ratio of K to Hz, which tells us how many moles of
 K there are compared to Ho.

       2K(s) + 2H,O(l) + 2KOH(aq) + H,(g)

 K:H, = 2:1 therefore 0.2558 mol: 0.1279 mol

 Step 3: Calculate the volume of H,(g) produced in dm?.
 The final part of the question requires us to calculate the volume of H, produced. To do this we must
 decide which moles equation to use. As we are dealing with gases it leaves us with one obvious choice.
                     volume in dm?                _ volume in cm?
       moles =

294   MATHS SKILLS


                     Always check what units are required as you could lose valuable marks otherwise. This is usually stated
                     either in the question or next to the space provided to write the answer. This question has asked for the
                     answer to be shown in dm*. Rearranging this equation, substituting in the numerical values before solving
                     provides us with the answer.

                            volume in dm? = 0.1279 mol x 24 mol dm=? = 3.069 dm?

                     It is always good to check your answer following a long question like this. The best way is to work
                     backwards, and make sure we get 10g of K as the end point if you have time!



                     WORKED EXAMPLE
                     In the United Kingdom, there are currently 16 operational nuclear reactors located at 9 power stations.
                     However, as the country’s energy demands increase this number could rise. Recent surveys have found public
                     opinion is not in favour of this increase, due to risk of leaks and radiation exposure following an explosion. One
                     possible radioactive contaminant following an explosion is radioactive iodine, I*, which is taken up by a person's
                     thyroid gland. To counter this, potassium iodide, KI, is given to patients. This blocks the uptake of radioactive
                     iodine by the thyroid gland by swamping the body with non-radioactive iodine instead.

                     The current recommended dose of iodine, !,, is 130 mg.
                     Img=1x 107g
                     Calculate the mass of potassium iodide required to obtain the recommended dose of iodine.
                     Show your answer in mg.

                     This style of question requires you to think carefully about what the question is asking. Whilst there are
                     only two steps to finding the correct answer, this can still prove troublesome. This question is made harder
                     by the fact that we are using iodine, which is |,, rather than just I-. This means the molar mass is
                     2x 126.9gmol".
                     We must first determine the number of moles of iodine required, using the basic moles equation to do
                     so. We know It is this equation because we are dealing with solids and masses. Therefore the equation to
                     solve is

                                    moles =      a
                                              molar mass
                                0.130
                                        6   = 5.122 x 10°* mol
                            253.8 g mol"!

                     However, it takes two moles of potassium iodide, KI, to release one mole of I>. Therefore, the required moles
                     of KI is 2 x 5.122 x 10 = 1.024 x 10° mol. We can now work out the mass of potassium iodide by simply
                     changing the subject of the equation and solving it using the molar mass of KI as 166.0 g mol".

                            mass = moles x molar mass
                     However, the question has asked for the mass to be shown in units of mg. This means we must multiply
                     the answer by 1000. When answering any question it is better to leave the rounding to the end, in order
                     to avoid rounding errors.

                            (1.024 x 10-3 mol x 166.0) x 1000 = 170 mg
                                                                            MATHS SKILLS                             295


WORKED EXAMPLE
Copper(I!) chloride solution, CuCl,(aq), can be prepared by reacting excess powdered copper(I!) oxide, CuO(s),
with hot hydrochloric acid:

          CuO(s) + 2HCl(aq) — CuCl,(aq) + H,O(I)

Unreacted copper(I!) is then removed by filtration, and water is evaporated from the filtrate to leave crystals of
copper(I!) chloride-2-water, CuCl2.2H20.
In one such preparation, 50.0 cm? of 0.500 mol dm-? hydrochloric acid is used.
   (a) Calculate the amount (in moles) of hydrochloric acid used.
   (b) Calculate the minimum amount (in moles) of copper(II) oxide needed.
   (c) Calculate the mass of copper(I!) oxide needed, if an excess of 20% is necessary.
       Give your answer to two significant figures.

   (d) Calculate the molar mass of copper(I|) chloride-2-water, CuCl>.2H;O.
   (e) 1.81 g of copper(I!) chloride-2-water is obtained. Calculate the percentage yield.

In this type of question, you will need to perform a series of calculations, often using answers from earlier
in the question. Pay particular attention to units and follow the ‘NAUTE’ rule - no approximation until the
end! Give your final answer to an appropriate number of significant figures.

   (a) 50.0cm? = 0.50 dm?
              0.50 dm? x 0.5 mol dm=3 = 0.025 mol
   (b) From the equation we can see that one mole of CuO reacts with two moles of HCI. We therefore
       need half the number of moles of CuO than of HCI.

              0.025 mol = 2 = 0.0125 mol

   (c) To obtain an excess of 20%, we need 120% of the minimum number of moles we found in part (b).
       To calculate 120%, we can multiply by 1.2.

              excess = 0.0125 x 1.2 = 0.015 mol

       We can now find the mass required by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass of
       CuO.

              molar mass of CuO = 63.5 + 16.0 = 79.5
              mass of CuO required = 0.015 x 79.5 =1.1925¢

       The data in the question was given to three significant figures, so we give our final answer to two
       significant figures:

              mass of CuO required = 1.2g

   (d) We can calculate the molar mass using the relative atomic masses of the elements:

              molar mass of CuCl,.2H,O = 63.5 + (2 x 35.5) + (2 x 18.0) = 170.5

   (e) From part (b) we know that the expected number of moles is 0.0125. We can use our answer from
       (d) to calculate the mass of the expected yield.

              mass of expected yield = 0.0125 x 170.5 = 2.13 g
              percentage yield = 1.82 + 2.13 x 100 = 85%

    Average student answer

    The boiling temperature of the elements increases as you go
    down the group. This is because the intermolecular forces
                                                                           At this level, your answers need technical terms and clarity

    and so the boiling temperature increases. In some groups
    such as Group | the boiling temperature decreases because
    the intermolecular bonding is different and so that has a
    different effect on the boiling temperature. In other groups
    the boiling temperature increases and then decreases.


COMMENTARY
This is a weak answer because:

¢    Although the student has correctly stated that the boiling temperature increases down Group 7 and that this is due to
     increasing London forces, they have not explained why London forces increase down Group 7.

¢    The student has written about the trend in boiling temperatures in Group | and other groups. The question specifically
     asks about Group 7 so this information cannot gain any marks.

Question analysis

   There will be questions in your exams which assess your understanding of practical skills and draw on your experience of
   the core practicals. For these questions, think about:

   how apparatus is set up

   the method of how the apparatus 1s to be used

   how readings are to be taken

   how to make the readings reliable

   how to control any variables.

   It helps with extended writing questions to think about the number of marks available and how they might be distributed.
   For example, if the question asked you to give the arguments for and against a particular case, then assume that there
   would be equal numbers of marks available for each side of the argument and balance the viewpoints you give accordingly.
   However, you should also remember that marks will also be available for giving an overall conclusion so you should be
   careful not to omit that.

   It is vital to plan out your answer before you write it down. There is always space given on an exam paper to do this so just
  jot down the points that you want to make before you answer the question in the space provided. This will help to ensure
   that your answer is coherent and logical and that you don’t end up contradicting yourself. However, once you have written
   your answer go back and cross these notes out so that it is clear they do not form part of the answer.

COMMENTARY
This is an average answer because:

e The student has given results for all of the tests. However, in several cases the results are not given precisely enough for the
   marks to be scored. For example, for chloride ions the student does not specify whether the silver chloride precipitate will
   dissolve in dilute or concentrated ammonia and so does not score the second mark.

Calculate the empirical formula of this product.                      [2]   a unit, this must be included.

Question analysis

e    The important thing with calculations is that you must show your working clearly and fully. The correct answer on the line
     will gain all the available marks. However, an incorrect answer can gain all but one of the available marks if your working
     is shown and is correct.

e    Show the calculation that you are performing at each stage and not just the result. When you have finished, look at your
     result and see if it is sensible. In an empirical formula calculation such as this one, if you do not end up with a whole
     number ratio for the atoms then you probably have an error in your calculation (have you divided the percentage of each
     element by the atomic number rather than the relative atomic mass?). Go back and check.

COMMENTARY
This is a strong answer because:

e The student has correctly divided each of the percentage masses by the M, of the element to obtain the number of moles
     and so gained the first mark.

e    The student has used the moles to correctly work out the ratio of the number of atoms of each element and so has obtained
     the second of the available marks.

e    The answer has been laid out very clearly so that even if an error had been made then a mark could have been awarded for
     part of the calculation.
