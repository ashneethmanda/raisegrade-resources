       Exam Practice
       Exam-style questions at
       the end of each chapter are
       tailored to the Pearson Edexcel
       specification to allow for practice
       and development of exam
       writing technique. They also
       allow for practice responding
       ‘to the command words used in
       the exams (see the command
       words glossary at the back of
       this book).
       You can also refer to the
       Preparing for Your Exams
       section at the back of the book,
       for sample exam answers with
       commentary.
PRACTICAL SKILLS
Practical work is central to the study of chemistry. The second year of the Pearson Edexcel International Advanced
Level (IAL) Chemistry course includes eight Core Practicals that link theoretical knowledge and understanding to
practical scenarios.

Your knowledge and understanding of practical skills and activities will be assessed in all examination papers for the IAL
Chemistry qualification.

e    Papers 4 and 5 will include questions based on practical activities, including novel scenarios.

e    Paper 6 will test your ability to plan practical work, including risk management and selection of apparatus.

In order to develop practical skills, you should carry out a range of practical experiments related to the topics covered
in your course. Further suggestions in addition to the Core Practicals are included in the specification, which is available
online.

TOPIC 17 KINETICS

Your health depends on a complex interplay of a large number of chemical reactions taking place in the cells of
your body. In a healthy body, these reactions will take place at the correct rate, in the right place and at the
right time. These reactions are controlled by enzymes. The branch of chemistry concerned with the rates of
chemical reactions is called chemical kinetics. The term ‘kinetics’ implies motion and comes from the ancient
Greek word for movement, kinesis. We can use the information obtained from the study of chemical kinetics to:

  understand the body’s metabolism (the chemical processes in the body)

  model the effects of pollutants in the Earth’s atmosphere

  develop new catalysts, which is of great importance to the chemical industry.

In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS), we used a qualitative approach to the understanding of reaction rates. In this topic
we will develop this further by adopting a quantitative approach. This will enable us to begin to understand
what is happening during chemical reactions:

  We know how atoms can bond together to form molecules, but why do the atoms change partners during
  chemical reactions?

  What exactly happens when a hydrogen molecule meets an iodine molecule and they subsequently react to
  produce hydrogen iodide?

It has been reported by scientists that the herb ginseng may be just as effective as Prozac at treating
depression. Herbs and plant extracts have been used for centuries to cure diseases and to relieve pain. In
many cases they are effective because they control the rates of chemical reactions within the body. In this
topic we will study the rates of chemical reactions and the mechanisms by which they take place.

TECHNIQUE 2: MEASURING THE CHANGE IN MASS OF A REACTION MIXTURE
This is another technique applicable to reactions in which a gas is evolved.

The reaction flask and contents are placed on a digital balance and the decrease in mass is measured
as the reaction proceeds (fig C).                                                                          A. fig C Cotton wool is placed in

carbon dioxide. With a low-density (i.e. low relative molecular mass) gas such as hydrogen, the mass
changes are so small that the measurement uncertainties become significant.


TECHNIQUE 3: MONITORING A COLOUR CHANGE (COLORIMETRY)
Colour change can sometimes be monitored using observation only. However, using a colorimeter
gives more precise results (fig D). A colorimeter can detect far more subtle changes than the human
eye can observe, and provides a quantitative (rather than a subjective) measurement.

TECHNIQUE 4: ANALYSIS BY TITRATION
This technique involves using a pipette to remove small samples (aliquots) from a reaction mixture
at regular intervals. The reaction in the aliquot can either be stopped by adding another substance
to it or slowed down to almost zero by immersing it in an ice bath. The aliquot is then titrated to
determine the concentration of a reactant or product species.

The process of stopping or slowing down the reaction in an aliquot is known as ‘quenching’.

For example, if the reaction involves an acid, the aliquot, after quenching, could be titrated against a
standard solution of sodium hydroxide to determine the concentration of the acid. This technique is
used to investigate the reaction between iodine and propanone, which is catalysed by acid. Sodium
hydrogen carbonate is added to the aliquot to remove the acid catalyst and, as a result, effectively
stops the reaction. The remaining iodine is then titrated against a standard solution of sodium
thiosulfate (fig E).

                        TECHNIQUE 5: MEASURING THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
                        If the total number, or type, of ions in solution changes during a reaction, it might be possible to
                        follow the reaction by measuring changes in the electrical conductivity of the solution using a
                        conductivity meter. For example, it could be used to follow this reaction:
                              5Br-(aq) + BrO3(aq) + 6H*(aq) > 3Br,(aq) + 3H,O(1)

RATE EQUATION
WHAT IS A RATE EQUATION?
The usual relationship between the rate of reaction and the concentration of a reactant is that the
rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration. In other words, as the concentration is
doubled, the rate of reaction doubles.

Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes the rate will double, but sometimes it will
increase by a factor of four. In some cases, the rate of reaction does not increase at all, or it increases
in an unexpected way.

Let us consider the simple relationship where the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of
a reactant, say A. We can represent this by the expression:

            rate x [A]

or:

            rate = k{A]

where xis the proportionality constant.

This is called the first order rate equation. The constant k is called the rate constant.
+        Every reaction has its own particular rate equation and its own rate constant.
+        Rate constants will only change their value with a change in temperature.

Other common rate equations with respect to an individual reactant are:
            second order rate equation:     rate = K{A}*
            zero order rate equation:           rate = k{A}° or rate = k

Zero order reactions do not occur very often, and it might be difficult at this stage for you to imagine
why they should occur at all. However, you will find out shortly why they can occur

If two or more reactants are involved, then it is possible to have a third order rate equation:
            third order rate equation:          rate = [APB]

THE UNITS OF RATE CONSTANTS
Table A shows the units for rate constants, using mol dm as the unit of concentration and seconds
as the unit of time. You find the units by rearranging the rate equation.

THE CONTINUOUS METHOD
In this method, one reaction mixture is made up and samples of
the reaction mixture are withdrawn at regular time intervals. The
reaction in the sample is stopped, if necessary, by quenching.
The concentration of the reactant is then determined by an
appropriate experimental technique, such as titration.

     different concentrations.

If you plot a graph of [N,Os] against time using the above data, you will find that the line is curved
and the half-life is constant; as a result, the reaction is first order with respect to NOs.

CALCULATING RATE FROM A CONCENTRATION-TIME GRAPH
The rate of reaction at any given time can be determined from a concentration-time or volume-time
graph by drawing a tangent to the curve at the given time and calculating the gradient of the tangent.

                           THE INITIAL-RATE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE RATE EQUATION
                           In this method, several reaction mixtures are made up and the initial rate (i.e. the time taken for a
                           fixed amount of reactant to be used up or for a fixed amount of product to be formed) is measured.
                           From these times, it is then possible to calculate the mathematical relationship between the rate of
                           the reaction and the concentration of the reactant.

                          A typical set of results is shown in table B for the reaction:

                           If we now look at experiments 1 and 3, we can see that [A] has doubled while [B] has remained
                           constant. The rate of reaction has also doubled. This indicates that the reaction is first order with
                           respect to A and, as a result, we can write:
                                 rate x [A]

                           If we now look at experiments 1 and 2, or experiments 3 and 4, we can see that [B] has doubled
                           while [A] has remained constant. The initial rate of reaction has also doubled. This indicates that the
                           rate of reaction is directly proportional to [B]. That is, the reaction is first order with respect to B.
                           As a result, we can write:
                                 rate x [B]

                           The overall order of the reaction is two, and the complete rate law (rate equation) is:

                                 rate = k{A][B]

                           Note that the numbers in table B were deliberately kept simple to illustrate a point. Real
                           experimental results rarely fit such an exact pattern, and you may have to look for the nearest whole
                           numbers to obtain orders.


                           DETERMINING ORDER FROM A RATE-CONCENTRATION GRAPH
                           The method described above to determine initial rates, with changing concentrations, results in
                           only approximate values for the initial rates. However, since most orders of reaction with respect to
                           individual reactants have integer values, this approximation is usually acceptable.

                           In an initial rates experiment, the time measured is that for a fixed amount of product to be formed,
                           or that for a fixed amount of reactant to be used up. Since the amount of product formed, or reactant
                           used up, is kept constant, the initial rate of reaction is proportional to the reciprocal of the time, ¢
                           measured. That is:
                                         1
                                 rate x +


                           This assumes that the rate is constant for the whole time period, t. However, this is not true because
                           as soon as the reaction starts the rate begins to decrease. The rate calculated from the expression
                           is, therefore, the mean (average) rate over time, t, and not the ¢rve initial rate of reaction. The

     (iii)   deduce a possible mechanism for the reaction.


REACTION MECHANISMS
You will remember from Book1 that the basic view as to how a reaction takes place at a particulate
level is that particles (atoms, molecules, ions or radicals) first have to collide in the correct orientation
and with sufficient energy for products to be formed.

For the following reaction:

      P + Q = products

‘we expect the rate law to be:
      rate = A{P][Q]

In other words, we might expect the reaction to be first order with respect to each reactant and
second order overall.

ELEMENTARY REACTIONS
A reaction taking place in this manner (a single collision between the two reactant particles) is
described as being elementary.

If we know that a reaction is elementary, then we can deduce the rate law directly from the
stoichiometric equation. For example, the following reaction is known to be elementary:

      NO(g) + O3(g) > NO,(g) + O28)
so the rate equation is:
      rate = k{NO][O3]

The reaction takes place when a molecule of NO collides with a molecule of O3.

If the reaction is not elementary, it is not possible to deduce the rate equation by simply looking at
the stoichiometric equation for the reaction.

For example, the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide into nitrogen dioxide and oxygen is first
order with respect to dinitrogen pentoxide, not second.

      2N,05(g) > 4NO,(g) + O.(g)
The experimentally determined rate equation is:

      rate = k{N,Os]

A reaction that is not elementary takes place via a series of interconnected elementary reactions that
are collectively called the mechanism for the reaction. You will have already come across a number of
such mechanisms in your study of organic chemistry. For example, the radical substitution reaction
between methane and chlorine to form chloromethane (CH,Cl) is thought to have the following
mechanism:

The rate-determining step is bimolecular because there are two reactant particles present.

It is a continuous single one-step reaction. The complex shown in square brackets is not an intermediate

 The influence ofthe iodine on the reaction rate may be studied if the concentrations of propanone and
 hydrogen ions effectively remain constant during the reaction. This is achieved by using a large excess of
 both propanone and acid in the original reaction mixture. You will investigate this in CP9A Following the

 Analysis of results
 The graph produced shows that the reaction is zero order with respect to iodine.

 Similar experiments show that the reaction is first order with respect to both propanone and hydrogen ions.

 This gives us the following rate equation:
          rate = k[CH3;COCHS][H*]
 This would suggest the following reaction as the first step of the reaction:

ACTIVATION ENERGY, E,
In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS), we defined activation energy, £,, as the minimum energy that colliding
particles must possess for a reaction to occur.

The activation energy represents the energy that the colliding particles must obtain in order to reach
the energy level of the transition state (see Section 11A.6 for more details). Once the energy level of
the transition state has been reached, the particles can react to form the products and release energy
as they do so. The energy profile diagram for an exothermic reaction is shown in fig A.

CATALYSTS
In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS), we defined a catalyst as a substance that increases the rate of a chemical
reaction but is chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

We then went on to explain that a catalyst works by providing an alternative route for the reaction,
and that this alternative route has a lower activation energy than the original route. Although the
original route is still available for the reactants, most collisions resulting in reaction will occur by the
alternative route, since the fraction of particles possessing this lower activation energy will be greater.

Catalysts can be divided into two groups:
+    homogeneous catalysts
+    heterogeneous catalysts.


HOMOGENEOUS CATALYSTS
A homogeneous catalyst is in the same phase (solid, liquid, solution or gas) as the reactants.

      THE RATE CONSTANT

i Use the Arrhenius equation to explain the effect of temperature on the rate constant of a reaction.
® Use calculations and graphical methods to find the activation energy for a reaction from experimental data.


                              RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND RATE OF REACTION
                              In Book 1 we discussed qualitatively why an increase in temperature increased the rate of a reaction.
                              There are two reasons for this:
                              *    an increase in the fraction of molecules with energy equal to or greater than the activation energy
                                   for the reaction
                              *    an overall increase in the frequency of collisions between the reacting molecules.

                              The second effect is considerably less significant than the first and means that we can effectively
                              ignore the overall increase in the frequency of collisions.

                                   reactions can only occur when the molecules are correctly orientated at the time of collision.

    When we state that the relationship between Ink and —— is linear, we have assumed that both E, and A

    remain constant over a range of temperatures. This is not strictly true. However, the change in the values of
    E, and A with temperature are insignificant compared with the effect of temperature on the rate constant,
    and so can be ignored.



    DID YOU KNOW?
The significance of the factor enn
The factor e~ir represents the fraction of collisions that have energy equal to or greater than the
activation energy, E,. For example, a reaction with an E, of 60 kJ mol"’ gives a fraction, at 298 K, of:
          e~(60000/8.31 x 298) _ 3 x 4Q-11


    So, only one collision in 3 x 10"' has sufficient energy to react.
Itis often assumed that the fraction of collisions with energy equal to or greater than E, is the same as
the fraction of molecules with this energy. This is not strictly true, but the difference is insignificant at
high energies, where the fraction is very small.

Itis, therefore, reasonable to draw the molecular energy distribution curve, instead of the collision
frequency curve, when demonstrating the effect of temperature on collision frequency. (See Topic 9
(Book 1: IAS).



LEARNING TIP
The effect of E, on reaction rate:
+     reactions with a large E, are slow, but the rate increases rapidly with an increase in temperature
+     reactions with a small E, are fast, but the rate does not increase as rapidly with an increase in
      temperature

+     catalysed reactions have small values of E,.

                         ©     an intermediate has an energy minimum
                               a transition state occurs at the top of the energy curve and therefore has an energy maximum.
                         An intermediate is a definite chemical species that exists for a finite length of time. By comparison, a
                         transition state has no significant permanent lifetime of its own: it exists for a period of the order of
                         10-'5 seconds, when the molecules are in contact with one another. Even a very reactive intermediate,
                         with a lifetime of only 10-® seconds, has a long lifetime in comparison with the period that colliding

As the stability of the carbocation increases, the activation energy for the reaction leading to its
formation also decreases.

We therefore expect the rate of the S,1 reaction to increase in the order 1° < 2° < 3°.
No carbocations are formed during the Sy2 reaction. In an Sy2 reaction, the transition state has five
groups arranged around the central carbon atom. It is therefore more crowded than either the starting
halogenoalkane or the alcohol product, each of which have only four groups around the central carbon atom.
Alkyl groups are much larger than hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the more alkyl groups around the
central carbon atom, the more crowded will be the transition state, and the higher the activation
energy for its formation.
We therefore expect the rate of the S,2 reaction to increase in the order 3° < 2°< 1°.
The two effects reinforce one another. The Sy1 reaction is fastest with tertiary halides and slowest with
primary halides, while the S$y2 reaction is fastest with primary halides and slowest with tertiary halides.        CHECKPOINT
Overall, primary halides react predominantly via the Sy2 mechanism and tertiary halides react predominantly
via the Sy1 mechanism. Secondary halides tend to react via a mixture of the two mechanisms.

DID YOU KNOW?
Although a typical adult has only about 1.5 mg of copper per kg of body mass, an inability to regulate
copper has disastrous effects. For example, the inability to excrete excess copper from the body
(Wilson’s disease) can be fatal if left untreated. Menkes’ syndrome manifests itself if the body is
unable to retain (hold on to) copper. Although not fatal, it can lead to developmental delay and
neurological problems.

        ENTROPY AND
ENERGETICS

People lived very simply in the Stone Age. Their energy needs were supplied by the Sun, and by burning
plants and trees. Because the plants and trees were continuously renewed, and populations were small, energy
supplies during the Stone Age period were plentiful. However, this simple lifestyle has almost completely
vanished, and people today cannot survive without abundant fuel.

Today, most of the world’s energy is supplied from fossil fuels, which consist of natural gas, coal and products
from crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Fossil fuels are not renewable and will one day run out.
To manage these energy resources and develop new fuels we need to understand how energy is released or
used in chemical reactions, including the reactions in plants, animals and our own bodies.

Energy is an essential part of chemistry as well as of civilisation as we know it. In chemistry, energy determines
which reactions can occur and which compounds can exist. You have already studied a large number of
chemical reactions. All of these reactions either absorb or release energy. In this topic we will develop an
understanding of how to measure and report these energy changes.

Have you ever wondered why water evaporates? Why hot objects cool? Why hydrogen combines with
oxygen? Why green leaves turn red in the autumn? Why anything happens? Part of the answer is related to
energy. We need energy to think, to move and to live. Every chemical reaction makes use of energy to
rearrange the bonding between elements in compounds. Thermodynamics deals with questions like these.

In the first half of this topic we will deal with the second law of thermodynamics, which governs the direction
of natural change. The second law enables us to predict whether or not a reaction has a tendency to occur,
and to what extent it will occur. The second law is of fundamental importance in chemistry because it provides
a basis for discussing, explaining and predicting equilibria, the subject of Topics 13 and 14 in this book. The
second law is also the foundation of the whole field of electrochemistry, the subject of Topic 16.

            RNING OBJECTIVES

    TM@   Understand that, since endothermic reactions can occur spontaneously at room temperature, enthalpy changes alone do not
          control whether reactions occur.
    TM@   Understand entropy as a measure of disorder of a system in terms of the random dispersal of molecules and of energy quanta
          between molecules.
    TM@   Understand that the entropy of a substance increases with temperature, that entropy increases as
          solid — liquid — gas and that perfect crystals at zero kelvin have zero entropy.
    TM@   Be able to interpret the natural direction of change as being in the direction of increasing total entropy (positive entropy
          change), including gases spread spontaneously through a room.

There are other types of reactions that simply do not occur at all,        As the products have less energy than the reactants, we often say
at least not without some help. For example:                               that the products are more energetically stable than the reactants.

*      ammonium chloride does not spontaneously decompose into             It is very tempting to conclude that this reaction occurs because

But first, we need to appreciate what is meant by the term
spontaneous process.



SPONTANEOUS PROCESSES
A spontaneous process is one that takes place without continuous
intervention by us.

A good example of a spontaneous process is the freezing of water
to form ice. If water is placed in an environment at —20 °C it will
turn into ice. However, the reverse will never happen: at —20 °C
ice will never melt to form water

Another example of a spontaneous process is the mixing of
gases. If two unreactive gases are present in a container, they will    A.   fig

At the beginning of this section we stated that, in chemistry, we
are concerned with whether or not chemical reactions will occur,
and we suggested that perhaps the most important question to ask
in chemistry is ‘Why does a reaction occur?’

                                   Each molecule has two possible arrangements. It can be in either the left-hand jar or the right-hand
                                   jar. We can write the number of possible arrangements for molecule 1 as W,, and the number of
                                   possible arrangements for molecule 2 as W>, and so on.

                                   As there are two possible arrangements for molecule 1, W, = 2. For molecule 2, W, = 2, and so on.

                                   The equation for the ‘oral number of ways, W, that the five molecules can be arranged is given by:
                                          W=W, x         W,x W;x       W,x    Ws

                                                =2x2x2x2x2
                                                =2

                                                = 32

                                   Most of the 32 possible arrangements have molecules in both jars. Only one has all five molecules in
                                   the left-hand jar. It would be surprising if this arrangement happened very often.

                                   If we increase the number of molecules to 100, Wbecomes 2. The left-hand gas jar would contain
                                   all 100 molecules only once in every 3.2 x 10”? years! We would have to wait for a very long time
                                   indeed to see all 100 molecules in the left-hand jar!

                                   You can see that as the number of molecules increases, the number of possible arrangements also
                                   increases very rapidly. To make the numbers easier to work with we need to use an equation to help

The distribution of the quanta between molecules is random. The more quanta there are, the more
ways there are of arranging them between the molecules. Also, the more molecules there are, the
more ways there are of sharing the quanta.

As an example, table B shows that there are five possible arrangements of four quanta between
two molecules. Table C shows that there are six possible arrangements of five quanta between two
molecules. Table D shows that there are 10 possible arrangements of three quanta between three
molecules.

The higher the temperature, the more energy a substance has. The more energy a substance has, the
more ways there are to distribute the energy. The more ways there are to distribute the energy, the
higher the entropy. So, increasing the temperature will increase the entropy.

PERFECT CRYSTALS
A ‘perfect’ crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure is the same at all times. In other words,
the particles (atoms, molecules or ions) are fixed and are not moving in any way, rotating or vibrating.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at the temperature of
absolute zero (i.e. 0 K) is zero.


THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is sometimes misquoted. You may have come across the
statement that in a spontaneous change, entropy always increases. This cannot be true: if it were,
water could never freeze because this change involves a decrease in entropy.

Another example is the reaction between ammonia gas and hydrogen chloride gas:
       NH,(g) + HCl(g) + NH,Cl(s)

Clearly, there is a reduction in the entropy of the system, since two gases are forming a solid, yet this
reaction occurs spontaneously at room temperature.

The statement entropy always increases is almost correct. It needs to be expressed more carefully to
give the Second Law of Thermodynamics:
                                                                                                                    UBJECT VOCABULARY
In a spontaneous process, the ‘otal entropy increases.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

TM@   Understand that the total entropy change of any reaction is the sum of the entropy change of the system and the entropy
      change of the surroundings, summarised by the expression:

      ASrotat = AScystem + ASsurroundings
@     Be able to calculate the entropy change of the system for a reaction, AS.,.t.m, given the entropies of the reactants and products.

TM    Be able to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings, and hence AS,q.,1, using the expression
                          AH
      AS surroundings =
TM@   Understand that the feasibility of a reaction depends on:
      (i)   the balance between AS. tem aNd AS.urroundings: SO that even endothermic reactions can occur spontaneously at room
            temperature
      (ii) temperature, as higher temperatures decrease the magnitude OfAS...,oundings: SO its contribution to AS,ora\ is less.

lM    Understand that reactions can occur as long as AS,,1, is positive even if one of the other entropy changes is negative.

TM@   Understand and distinguish between the concepts of thermodynamic stability and kinetic stability.



                                        TOTAL ENTROPY CHANGE, AS;,ta
                                        The total entropy change of a process comprises two components:

                                        +    the entropy change of the system, AS.,.cem. and

                                        +    the entropy change of the surroundings, ASsuroundings-

                                        In a chemical reaction, the system is the species that are taking part in the reaction.

                                        The surroundings is everything else. In practice, this usually means the reaction vessel, e.g. test tube
                                        or beaker, and the air in the laboratory.

                                        The total entropy change is defined as the sum of the entropy change of the system and the entropy
                                        change of the surroundings. That is:

                                                AScorat = ASsystem + ASsurroundings
                                        For a reaction to be spontaneous, AS,,.,, must be positive. This is another way of expressing the
                                        Second Law of Thermodynamics.


                                            DID YOU KNOW?
                                            The official definition of the Second Law of Thermodynamics does not use the term ‘total entropy
                                            change’. Instead, it refers to the ‘entropy change of the universe’. These two terms have the same
                                            meaning. We will use the term ‘total entropy change’ throughout this book.


                                        ENTROPY CHANGE OF THE SYSTEM
                                        AS.ysiem is calculated using the expression:

                                                ASsystem = 2S (products) — ES (reactants)

                                        where S represents entropy and & represents ‘the sum of’.

                                        The standard entropy values of some substances are shown in table A.

                                        Standard refers to conditions of 100 kPa and 298 K.

ENTROPY CHANGE OF THE SURROUNDINGS
The entropy change of the surroundings, AS,u;oundings: iS related to the enthalpy change of the

For an exothermic reaction, where AH is negative, AS,.:ouncings Will always be positive, so the entropy
of the surroundings increases.

Conversely, for an endothermic reaction, AS..r,oundings Will always be negative, so the entropy of the
surroundings decreases.

                                  THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC STABILITY
                                  The reaction between methane and oxygen is exothermic, and the total entropy change has a
                                  positive value:

                                          CH,(g) + 20,(g) + CO,(g) + 2H,O(l)            AH,° = —890.3 kJ mol!
                                                                                        ASvota = +2.95 kJ mol

                                  Since AS... is positive, the reaction is thermodynamically feasible at 298 K. However, the reaction
                                  does not take place until the reaction mixture is ignited, usually with a flame.

                                  The added heat energy is required to overcome the high activation energy of the reaction.

                                  A reaction mixture with a high activation energy, where a reaction will not take place spontaneously
                                  at room temperature, is said to be kinetically stable.

                                  You can see here that a reaction mixture (such as methane and oxygen) can be thermodynamically
                                  unstable but kinetically stable, so a reaction does not take place under standard conditions.


                                  THE ROLE OF TEMPERATURE
                                  The increase in entropy obtained by supplying a certain amount of heat energy to an object depends
                                  on the temperature of the system.

                                  If an object is very cold, the molecules are not moving around very much. Supplying some heat
                                  energy to the object will make the molecules move around more, so the entropy increases.

                                  If we supply the same amount of heat energy to a much hotter object, the entropy will still increase,
                                  but not by as much as with the cold object. This is because in the hot object the molecules are
                                  already moving around vigorously and the increased degree of movement is less for the hot object.


                                  WHY DOES WATER FREEZE?
                                  We will now apply these principles to explain why, under certain conditions, water will freeze.

                                  Ice has lower entropy than liquid water, 80 AS.ystem 18 negative.

                                  The process is exothermic, 80 AS..::oundings iS positive.

The total entropy change is positive, meaning that the change is thermodynamically spontaneous.
The water will freeze.

It is interesting to note that what has changed between +5 °C and —5 °C is the entropy of the
surroundings. The reason that AS,.,;oundings has changed in magnitude is simply because of the
temperature change. The same amount of heat energy has been transferred to the surroundings
but, because the entropy of the surroundings has a higher temperature when at +5 °C than when at
—5 °C, the change in entropy is smaller, as explained earlier.

So, the reason we put water into a freezer when we want to make ice is because the entropy change
of the surroundings (i.e. essentially the air inside the freezer) is large enough to compensate for the
decrease in entropy when the water freezes.

REACTIONS INVOLVING A CHANGE IN NUMBER OF MOLES FROM
REACTANTS TO PRODUCTS
If you increase the number of moles that you have, you automatically increase the number of
particles (i.e. atoms, molecules or ions) present. This will result in an increase in the number of ways
that the particles can be arranged, and this increases the entropy of the system, making ASyyctem
positive.

We will now look again at the reactions shown above, but this time we will consider the change in the
number of moles from reactants to products.


EXAMPLE 1

        2CH,COOH()) + (NH,),CO,(s)
              — 2CH,COONH,(s) + H,O(1) + CO,(g)

Number of moles of reactants = 3

Number of moles of products = 4

So, AS.stem 18 positive.


EXAMPLE 2

              — BaCl,(s) + 10H,O(1) + 2NH,(g)

Number of moles of reactants = 3

Number of moles of products = 13

So, AS.;stem 18 positive.

                                  The standard enthalpy change of solution becomes more negative down the group. This favours

                                  The values of the entropies of the hydrated cations become less negative (i.e. more positive), and this
                                  also favours solubility.

                                  As both factors favour an increase in solubility, the metal hydroxides become more soluble as you go

Again, the values for the standard entropy of the sulfate ion have been left out here, because the ion
is common to all of the metal sulfates. The trend in the standard entropies of the cations mirrors the
trend in the standard entropy change of the system, ASS ym:

The standard enthalpy change of solution becomes less negative down the group. This favours
insolubility, as ASSurroundings becomes less positive.

The values of the entropy of the hydrated cation become less negative (i.e. more positive), and this
also favours solubility.

The overall decrease in AS$.r:oundings down the group is 368 JK~' mol"! (+ 305 to -63).

The overall increase in the standard entropy change of the hydrated cations is 148 JK~! mol"!
(-138 to +10).

As the decrease in the standard entropy of the hydrated cations is much less than the increase in
the entropy of the surroundings, the Group 2 metal sulfates become less soluble as you go down
the group.


 LEARNING TIP
 At this level, it is assumed that AS.,.tem does not change with temperature, since the entropies of both the
 reactants and the products change by similar amounts.

 The magnitude of AS.yrroundings Will always decrease with increasing temperature. If AS.urroundings is negative, it
 will become less negative. If AS..,,oundings 'S positive, it will become less positive.

 Evidence from thermodynamics does not indicate the rate at which a reaction will occur. A reaction that is
 thermodynamically spontaneous at a given temperature may have a high activation energy. This could
 result in the reaction not taking place at all.

      THEORETICAL LATTICE ENERGIES
 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Understand that a comparison of the experimental lattice energy value (obtained from a Born-Haber cycle) with the
    theoretical value (obtained from electrostatic theory) in a particular compound indicates the degree of covalent bonding.
TM@ Understand that polarisation of anions by cations leads to some covalency in an ionic bond, based on evidence from the
    Born-Haber cycle.

                                    The Born-Haber cycle allows us to calculate a value for the lattice energy of an ionic compound
                                    from knowledge of the other energy changes, all of which can be determined experimentally.
                                    The value of the lattice energy calculated this way is called the experimental lattice energy.

The covalency in bonding is caused by polarisation of the anion by the cation. Polarisation results
in distortion of the electron density within the anion, resulting in a higher electron density near the
cation. This means that there is some electron density existing between the two ions. In other words,
there will be a degree of covalent bonding in the compound.


EXTENT OF COVALENT CHARACTER: POLARISATION OF THE ANION
In an ionic lattice, the positive ion (cation) will attract the electrons of the anion. If the electrons                 Cation                 Anion
are pulled towards the cation, the anion is said to be polarised because the even distribution of its
electron density has been distorted (fig A).

The extent to which an anion is polarised by a cation depends on several factors. The two main
factors are summarised below. These are known as Fajan’s Rules.

Polarisation will be increased by:
                                                                                                                         Cation
+    ahigh charge and small size of the cation (i.e. a high charge density of the cation)

*    ahigh charge and large size of the anion.


HIGH CHARGE AND SMALL SIZE OF CATION
The ability of a cation to attract electrons from the anion towards itself is called its ‘polarising
power’. A cation with a high charge and a small radius has a large polarising power. An approximate                      Cation
value for the polarising power of a cation can be obtained by calculating its charge density
(sometimes called surface charge density). The charge density of a cation is the charge divided by
the surface area of the ion. If the ion is assumed to be a sphere, its surface area is equal to 47r?,
where ris the ionic radius.

A rough approximation of the charge density can be determined by dividing the charge by the square
                                                                                                                    Region where electrons are existing

charge and a large size are polarised most easily.

      SOLUTION AND HYDRATION
  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 1    Define the terms ‘enthalpy change of solution, A,.,H’, and ‘enthalpy change of hydration, A,,,4H of an ion’.

 Use energy cycles and energy level diagrams to calculate the enthalpy change of solution of an ionic compound using the
      enthalpy change of hydration and the lattice energy

 Understand the effect of ionic charge and ionic radius on the values of the enthalpy change of hydration and the lattice energy
      of an ionic compound.



ENTHALPY CHANGE OF SOLUTION, A,,,H
The solubilities of ionic solids in water show a very wide variation, and there is no obvious pattern.

One of the factors that determines solubility is the value of the enthalpy change of solution,
AgoiH, the enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic solid dissolves in water to form an infinitely
dilute solution.

The enthalpy change of solution for sodium chloride is the energy change associated with the
following process:

        NaCl(s) “4+ Na*(aq) + Cl-(aq)
It is important to specify the extent of dilution of the final solution when quoting a value for the
enthalpy change. Upon dilution, the ions in the solution move further apart (an endothermic process)
and also become more hydrated (an exothermic process).

The relative importance of these two processes (endothermic and exothermic) changes with dilution,
and they affect the value of A... in a complicated way. For this reason, the quoted values for A...
refer to an infinitely dilute solution. This value cannot be determined experimentally and is found
by a process of extrapolation.

In practice, there comes a point when further dilution has no measurable effect on A,,,7. This is
known as the point of infinite dilution.

Enthalpy changes of solution can be either negative or positive, as is shown in table A.

ENTHALPY CHANGE OF HYDRATION, A,,yH
The enthalpy change of hydration, A,,,,H, is the enthalpy change when one mole of an ion in
its gaseous state is completely hydrated by water. In practice, complete hydration is said to have
occurred when the solution formed is at infinite dilution.

For the sodium and chloride ions, the enthalpy change of hydration is the enthalpy change for the
following processes:

          Na(g) “4 Na*(aq)
and       CI-(g) *% Cr(aq)

                                    When an ion is placed in water it immediately interacts with the water molecules. Water molecules
                                    are polar (see Topic 3 (Book 1: IAS)) and are attracted to both positive and negative ions. Fig A
                                    shows the hydration of sodium and chloride ions.

                                    In the case of the sodium ion, the interaction is the result of the attraction between the 5~ oxygen
                                    atom of the water molecule and the cation. Such an interaction is often referred to as an ion-dipole
                                    interaction. With some other positive ions, notably those of the transition metals, a dative covalent
                                    bond is formed between the water molecule and the cation using one of the lone pairs of electrons
                                    on the oxygen atom.

                                    lon-dipole interactions exist in the hydrated chloride ion, but some hydrogen bonds are also formed
                                    between the 5+ hydrogen atoms of the water molecules and the chloride ion, making use of the lone
                                    pairs of electrons on the chloride ion (see Topic 7 (Book 1: IAS)).

                                    Enthalpy changes of hydration are always negative. Some examples are given in table B.

        CHEMICAL
EQUILIBRIA
A CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIA
Whenever chemical engineers design a chemical plant to manufacture a new chemical they must overcome a
problem. They want the best possible yield from the reactants, but they find that most chemical reactions do
not go to completion because they are reversible and can reach a state of dynamic equilibrium.

All reactions have a tendency to approach equilibrium, whether they seem to go to completion or whether
they seem to form no products at all. In many cases, such as the combustion of a fuel, the equilibrium
composition corresponds to the complete conversion of reactants into products.

Reactions that don’t seem to take place at all, like the corrosion of gold in air, also tend to approach
equilibrium, but in these cases the equilibrium composition corresponds to virtually unchanged reactants.

Many reactions approach an equilibrium in which there are significant amounts of both reactants and
products present. Finding and controlling the position of equilibrium in such reactions is the focus of
this topic.

                                HOMOGENEOUS REACTIONS
                                A homogeneous reaction is one in which all reactants and products are in the same phase. For
                                example, all are gases or all are in aqueous solution.
                                In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS) we saw how the position of equilibrium of a reversible reaction can change
                                when the conditions are altered.
                                In this section, we will study quantitatively how changes in concentration affect the equilibrium position.

                                For the reversible reaction:

                                         N,0.(8) = 2NO,(g)
                                it can be shown experimentally that at equilibrium and at a given temperature:

                                         (NO,(g)Feq
                                                       =a constant
                                         [N,0.(8)leq
                                This value is called the equilibrium constant and is given the symbol K..
                                The subscript ‘c’ indicates that this equilibrium constant is calculated using concentrations. This is to
                                distinguish it from another equilibrium constant, K,, which uses partial pressures.
                                The subscript ‘eq’ indicates that the concentrations are those at equilibrium.
                                At a given temperature, the value of the equilibrium constant does not change with concentration,
                                unlike the equilibrium position. The only factor that affects the value of the equilibrium constant
                                is temperature.

                                There are two ways of obtaining a value for the equilibrium constant:
                                «     the first is by experimentation, and this is the method we will look at in this section
                                *     the second is by calculation using thermodynamic equations, and this will be covered in Section 13A.5.

                                For a general reaction:

                                         wA + xB =yC+zD

                                For convenience, the ‘eq’ sign is often not included, but is taken for granted.

                                DETERMINATION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT
                                To determine the value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction, known amounts of reactants are
                                allowed to reach equilibrium with their products. At equilibrium, the amount of one of the substances
                                is measured and the amounts of the others can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the equation.

                                    WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                                    2.00 mol of ethanoic acid and 2.00 mol of ethanol are mixed and allowed to reach equilibrium with
                                    ethyl ethanoate and water at 298 K. The amount of ethanoic acid at equilibrium is found to be 0.67 mol.

HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS
A heterogeneous reaction is one in which at least one of the reactants and/or products is in a
different phase to the others.

Examples include:

                    CaCO,(s) = CaO(s) + CO,(g)

      3Fe(s) + 4H,O(g) = Fe;O,(s) + 4H,(g)

                      H,O(I)        = H*(aq) + OH (aq)


WRITING EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS FOR HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS
If we apply the equilibrium law to the reaction:

      CaCO,(s) = CaO(s) + CO,(g)

we obtain:

                             Asimilar situation exists for liquids that are in equilibrium with gases. For the equilibrium between
                             liquid water and water vapour:

                                    H,0(I) = H,0(9)

                             The partial pressure of water (p4,0) in equilibrium with its liquid is also known as the ‘saturated vapour
                             pressure’ of water.

                             At 298K, K,, and hence py,o, is equal to 0.03 atm; whereas at 373K, K,, and hence py,o, is equal
                             to 1.00 atm.

                             Since the boiling temperature of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which the saturated vapour
                             pressure equals the external pressure, the boiling temperature of water at 1 atm is 373K (100°C).

CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE ALTERS THE EQUILIBRIUM POSITION
If the equilibrium constant for a reaction changes with a change in temperature, then it follows that
the equilibrium position also changes. This is illustrated by the data in table C, which shows the value
of K, and the amounts of reactants and products at equilibrium for the reaction between hydrogen
and iodine to form hydrogen iodide:

 ®@ Understand how, if at all, a change in temperature, pressure or the presence of a catalyst affects the equilibrium composition in
     a homogeneous or heterogeneous system.

 TM@ Understand that the value of the equilibrium constant is not affected by changes in concentration or pressure or by the
     addition of a catalyst.


EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION
In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS) we saw that the equilibrium position changes when the concentration
of a component of the equilibrium mixture is altered. In this section we will discuss the effects of
concentration, pressure and catalysts on equilibrium constants and provide an explanation for this
phenomenon in terms of K,.

The most important thing to appreciate is that the only factor that can change the value of K. is a
change in temperature. That is, K. is constant at a given temperature.

When the concentration of one of the components of an equilibrium mixture is altered, there is an
immediate change in the reaction quotient, Q., which is the mathematical relationship between the
concentrations of the components.

At this point, the reaction quotient is no longer equal to the equilibrium constant, K,. Therefore, the
equilibrium composition changes until the reaction quotient and equilibrium constant become equal.

The following examples illustrate this process.


REACTION QUOTIENT, Q,
For a general reaction:

      wA + xB = yC + zD

the reaction quotient, Q., is given by the expression:

          _ (CHD
        °~ [AM BI
where the concentration terms are not necessarily those at equilibrium.

At equilibrium Q, = K..


 WORKED EXAMPLE 1

           H,(g) + 1g) = 2HI(g)

           They                      °" HLeIL@
    If [H2(g)] is suddenly increased, then Q. decreases and is no longer equal to K. .
    In order for equilibrium to be re-established, the magnitude of the denominator in the expression for
    Q, has to decrease in value.
    This will produce a subsequent increase in the value of the numerator.
    The two values will adjust until the value of Q. becomes equal to that of K- and a new equilibrium
    system is established.

 The net result of an increase in [H,(g)] is that the equilibrium shifts to the right. This is in agreement with
 the qualitative prediction that we made in Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS).

                       QUALITATIVE PREDICTIONS
                       In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS) we said that qualitative predictions do not always give us the correct
                       result. The worked example below shows this.

                       Step 2: Calculation of new total number of moles of gas.
                               Original total moles of gas = (0.510 + 0.197 + 0.204) = 0.911

                               New total moles of gas = (0.911 + 0.140) = 1.051

                       Step 3: Calculation of new volumeof gas mixture.

                               Since the pressure remains constant, the gas mixture will expand. If we assume that the gas mixture
                               behaves like an ideal gas, then the volume of gas is proportional to the number of moles:
                                   nV, =n,/V,

                               So the new volume of the gas mixture =

                                   (1.051 = 0.911)

                                                       = 1.154 dm?

                       Step 4: Calculation of Q, immediately after the addition of nitrogen.

                                   7           (0.204)°(1.154)?         AanE
                                   = GE5OV1.154 x (0.197)9A1.154F
                       Step 5: Compare Q. with K..

                               11.15 > 107, therefore Q. > K..

                       For equilibrium to be re-established, Q. must decrease. This can only happen by the equilibrium shifting
                       to the left, to increase the denominator in the equation.

                       The addition of more nitrogen, at constant pressure, results in a shift of the equilibrium position to the left.
                       Our prediction told us that the equilibrium would shift to the right, away from the nitrogen added.

                       The problem with making predictions is that two conflicting changes are occurring here:

                       1. the increase in the number of moles of nitrogen should result in a shift of equilibrium to the right

EFFECT OF PRESSURE
As with concentration, a change in pressure, at constant temperature, on an equilibrium system
containing gases has no effect on the value of either K, or K,.

Once again, any change in the equilibrium position occurs in order to maintain the equilibrium
constant at a constant value.

If the partial pressure of only one of the component gases is changed, then the overall effect on K,
can be predicted in the same way the effects of changes in concentration on K, were described in the
previous section.

However, if the total pressure of a gaseous system is suddenly increased or decreased, then the partial
pressures of ail the gases will either increase or decrease. The effect on the position of equilibrium can
be explained using the equilibrium law. This is shown in the following worked example.


 WORKED EXAMPLE 3
 Consider the reaction:

        No{g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH;(g)
 for which;
                    (nu?
        Ge                *
          *       (pw,) (Px)?
 Suppose the equilibrium partial pressures of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia are a, b and catm,
 respectively. Then:
                  @
        Ke
                  ab?
 If the total pressure is suddenly doubled, the partial pressures of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia will be
 doubled to 2a, 2b and 2c respectively:

              _         (cP     42
        = 59 x (26) T6ab?
 The value of Q,, is now one-quarter of the value of K,. In order to re-establish equilibrium the numerator
 has to increase, with a subsequent decrease in the denominator, until Q, = K,. This is achieved by some
 nitrogen and hydrogen reacting to form more ammonia.

 Hence, an increase in pressure increases the equilibrium yield of ammonia by shifting the equilibrium to
 the right.




EFFECT OF ADDING A CATALYST
The expression for an equilibrium constant of a given reaction contains only those substances
included in the overall stoichiometric equation for the reaction. A catalyst does not appear in the
overall equation, and so cannot influence the value of the equilibrium constant, and hence the
equilibrium position.

We can think about this in another way. In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS) you learned that a catalyst
increases the rate of both the forward reaction and the backward reaction to the same extent. The
catalyst therefore increases the rate at which equilibrium is established, but has no effect on the final
concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. Therefore, a catalyst has no effect on the value
of the equilibrium constant for a reaction.

                                     In hot water, the mixture becomes darker brown. The equilibrium position has shifted to the right
                                     to produce more NO). Note that the volume has become larger because the mixture expands as it

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT AND POSITION OF EQUILIBRIUM
There is no firm rule about the relationship between the equilibrium constant, K, and the position of
equilibrium of the reaction.

However, as a general rule we can say that a very large value of K suggests that the position of
equilibrium is well over to the products side (i.e. the right-hand side of the equation).

Similarly, a very small value of K suggests that the position of equilibrium is well over to the reactants
side (i.e. the left-hand side of the equation).

known that not all of the carbon dioxide we emit ends up in
the atmosphere. About 40% actually gets absorbed in the ocean
waters.

I like to use an analogy from everyday experience: the ocean is
a little like a soda. When we shake soda, it fizzes. That fizz is
the carbon dioxide coming out of the liquid (that is why sodas
are called “carbonated beverages”). We're doing the reverse
process in the climate. Our carbon dioxide is actually going into
the oceans.

The process of absorption is not simple — the amount of
carbon dioxide that the ocean can hold depends on the ocean

The evidence for anthropogenic climate change is now very strong. Using the Internet (including
the useful website https://climate.nasa.gov), carry out research to answer the following questions:

(i)     What is meant by anthropogenic climate change?
(ii)    Are there any other gases responsible for climate change? If so, what are they and how are
        they produced?
(iii) Some scientists now call the current geological time period the Anthropocene. What does
        this term mean and why do you think scientists are using it?

    EQUILIBRIA

       Acids and bases play an important part in our lives. They are extremely important in industry. Life itself
       depends on the complex networks of acid—base reactions taking place inside living organisms. To understand
       life, and death, we need to understand acids and bases and the reactions they undergo. In this topic we will
       build on the knowledge you have already gained on the properties of acids and bases. In particular, we will
       look at their properties quantitatively using the concept of equilibrium constants. We will also see how the
       strengths of acids are related to their molecular structures.

       The pH of your blood plasma is kept fairly constant at around 7.4 when your body is working normally. If it
   rises or falls by more than 0.4 from this normal value, you are likely to die.    The pH of your blood plasma can
       fall as a result of disease or shock, both of which can generate acidic conditions in your body. You are also
       likely to die if the pH of your blood plasma rises; this could happen during recovery from severe burns. To
       survive, your body must control its own pH. If your natural control systems fail, then you must be saved with
       medicine such as intravenous electrolyte solutions.

inthis topic we will look at how different ions affect pH, and how these ions can be used to control pH.

CALCULATING THE pH OF A DIBASIC ACID
Sulfuric acid is the most common dibasic acid. It dissociates in two stages:

      H,SO,(aq) > H*(aq) + HSO3(aq)

      HSOj(aq) = H*(aq) + SO}(aq)

H,SO, is a strong acid and is therefore fully dissociated. HSO; is a weak acid (K, = 0.0100 mol dm~*.)

In a 0.500 mol dmTM aqueous solution of H,SO, the contribution to the [H*(aq)] from the H,SO,
will be 0.500 mol dm~*. If we assume that the contribution to the [H*(aq)] from the HSO; ion is
xmol dm~%, then we have the following relationship:

      K, (HSO,") = 0.0100 = (0.500 — x)x/0.500

Solving this quadratic equation gives x = 0.0098.

This gives a total [H*(aq)] of 0.05098 mol dm with a subsequent pH of 0.293.

This calculation shows that the contribution to the [H*(aq)] from the HSO; ions is negligible. This
is because its dissociation is significantly reduced because of the high [H*(aq)] from the full first
ionisation of the H,SO,.

A second interesting reason for performing this calculation is because many books state that
0.5 mol dm~? H,SO,(aq) can be used as the acid solution in a standard hydrogen electrode (see
Topic 16 on standard electrode potentials). As the standard hydrogen electrode requires a [H*(aq)]
of 1.00 mol dm (pH = 0.00), this is clearly incorrect.

                                        Pure water has a slight electrical conductivity, so it must contain some ions. It self-ionises according
                                        to the following equation:

                                              H,O(1) = H*(aq) + OH“(aq)

                                        If we apply the equilibrium law to this reaction we obtain:

                                              (H*(aq)J[OH (aq)]

An aqueous solution of CH;COONH, is neutral (pH = 7.00) because it is the product of a weak acid
(CH,COOH) and a weak base (NH,), and the relative strengths of the acid and base are the same.
This is shown by their dissociation constants:

       CH,COOH: K, = 1.74 x 10°>moldmTM?
       NH;:                  74 x 10-5 mol dm?
 LEARNING TIP
 K, is a measure of acid strength and K,, is a measure of base strength.
 K,, for a base is calculated in a similar way to K, for an acid. The equilibrium set up when ammonia dissolves
 in water is:

 NH;(aq) + H2O(!) = NHi(aq) + OH-(aq)

You will notice that the pH increases by a factor of one unit for each 10-fold decrease in concentration.

If we follow this to its logical conclusion, then an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid of concentration
1.00 x 10° mol dm“ should have a pH of 8.00. This is clearly nonsense because this would mean
that a solution of an acid was alkaline.

Earlier in this topic we mentioned the fact that the contribution to the hydrogen ion concentration from
the dissociation of water can usually be ignored. When solutions are as dilute as 10-° mol dm this is
no longer the case. The pH of 10-*mol dm hydrochloric acid is very close to 7, as the contribution to
the concentration of hydrogen ions from the water (10~? mol dm“) is now greater than that of the acid.

ACID-BASE TITRATIONS
END POINT AND EQUIVALENCE POINT
When you carry out a simple acid-base titration, you usually
use an indicator to tell you when the acid and base are mixed
in exactly the right proportions to react in equivalent amounts,
as dictated by the stoichiometric equation. When the indicator
changes colour, this is often described as the ‘end point’ of the
                                                                            A    figA ApH meter.

The pH at the equivalence point depends on the combination
of acid and base used. For example, if you are titrating aqueous
sodium hydroxide with dilute hydrochloric acid, then the pH at the
equivalence point is 7.00 (at 298 K), as both the base and the acid

As there is no prominent steep section to the curve, neither indicator is suitable.

In fact, the end point of a titration of a weak acid and a weak base cannot be determined using an
acid-base indicator. The end point of such a titration is best determined by measuring the temperature
changes (thermometric titration) or electrical conductivity changes (conductometric titration).


TITRATION CURVES WITH DIPROTIC ACIDS
A diprotic acid is an acid that produces two H" ions per acid molecule. Examples of diprotic acids
are sulfuric acid, H,SO,, and carbonic acid, H,CO3.

A diprotic acid dissociates in water in two stages:

     Stage 1:            H,X(aq) > H*(aq) + HX“(aq)

     Stage 2:            HX-(aq) > H*(aq) + X*(aq)

This experiment involves performing a titration with an aqueous                The mixture at the half-equivalence point is a buffer solution (as
solution of a weak acid in a conical flask. From a burette, we add             stated above). The pH of a buffer solution is calculated using the
a standard solution of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide.                following equation:
We measure the pH of the solution after each addition.                                                        [salt]

Then we are able to plot a graph of pH against volume of base                                                 [acid]

CHIRALITY


In Book 1 you learned about the simplest hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) and how to name them using
IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) rules. You then considered halogenoalkanes and
alcohols, including important practical techniques used to convert one organic compound into another. You
learned how the analytical techniques of mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy are used to determine
the structures of organic compounds.

In this topic, you will extend your understanding of organic chemistry by considering compounds with
functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides and esters. This topic introduces
two more modern analytical techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chromatography.

Here are some important areas of organic chemistry you will encounter:

«   How measurements of optical activity can be used as evidence for organic reaction mechanisms

«   Howsimple chemical tests can be used to identify different functional groups

* The uses of esters in solvents, food flavourings and perfumes.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

@ Know that optical isomerism is a result of chirality in molecules with a single chiral centre.
Understand that optical isomerism results from chiral centre(s) in a molecule with asymmetric carbon atom(s) and that optical
   isomers (enantiomers) are object and non-superimposable mirror images and be able to draw 3D diagrams of these optical
   isomers.



                                  DIFFERENT TYPES OF ISOMERISM
                                  In Book 1, you learned about structural isomerism anzd its division into chain isomerism and position
                                  isomerism. You then considered a different type of isomerism called ‘geometric isomerism’, including
                                  the terms E-Z and cis-trans isomerism — this is one type of stereoisomerism.

                                 This chapter looks at a second type of stereoisomerism — optical isomerism. Before we introduce
                                 this, it is useful to consider all the types of isomerism that you need to be familiar with, in the form of
                                  a family tree.




                                  A   figA The isomerism family tree

                                  Structural isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but with different structural
                                  formulae.

                                  Functional group isomers differ because they have different functional groups (e.g. aldehydes and
                                  ketones, alcohols and ethers).

                                  Chain isomers differ because they have different patterns of branching in their carbon chains.

                                  Positional isomers differ because the same functional group is attached to different carbon atoms in
                                  the chain.

                                  Stereoisomers have the same structural formula but differ because their atoms or groups are
                                  arranged differently in three dimensions.

                                  Geometric isomers differ because their atoms or groups are attached at different positions on
                                  opposite sides of a C=C double bond.


                                  OPTICAL ISOMERISM
                                  How does optical isomerism fit into this family tree? Optical isomers are non-superimposable mirror
                                  images of each other but are otherwise the same. This needs careful explanation!

                                  CHIRALITY
                                  This is a term derived from the Greek word for ‘hand’, and could be translated as ‘handedness’. Many
                                  objects, including human hands, can be described as chiral. Your hands have the same features, and
                                  you could describe both hands using the same words. Both consist of a palm with a thumb on one

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

® Know that optical activity is the ability of a single optical isomer to rotate the plane of polarisation of plane-polarised
     monochromatic light in molecules containing a single chiral centre.

                                  PLANE-POLARISED LIGHT
                                  In the previous section we looked at the causes of optical isomerism. Before we consider optical
                                  activity, we must have some understanding of plane-polarised light. One way to consider light is
                                  as electromagnetic radiation that travels as a transverse wave. This means that the oscillations exist in
                                  planes at right angles to the direction of travel. Fig A shows ‘normal’ unpolarised light and plane-
                                  polarised light with the oscillations in only one plane.

                                                                             directions of

                                  Some natural materials, and synthetic materials such as Polaroid (the material used in some
                                  sunglasses), can absorb all of the oscillations except those in a single plane. This means that they
                                  convert unpolarised light into plane-polarised light. For convenience, the single plane that remains is
                                  often assumed to be the vertical plane, as shown in fig B.

                                  Fig B shows that the second sheet of Polaroid has horizontal lines, which means that only
                                  horizontally plane-polarised light can pass through. As the first sheet has produced vertically plane-
                                  polarised light, then no light can pass through the second sheet.

                                  POLARIMETRY
                                  Polarimetry is the use of a polarimeter to measure the amount of optical activity, if any, of a
                                  substance. Fig C shows howa polarimeter works. A monochromatic light source (light of only one
                                  colour or frequency) passes through a polarising filter (such as a piece of Polaroid). This is called the
                                  polariser because it converts unpolarised light into (vertically) plane-polarised light. The plane-
                                  polarised light then passes through a sample tube containing some of the substance in solution. If
                                  the substance is optically active (because it contains an enantiomer), then the plane of polarisation

                                    NUCLEOPHILIC SUBSTITUTION IN HALOGENOALKANES
                                    In Book 1 you learned to write mechanisms for these reactions, but this was limited. We suggested
                                    that the explanation given in Book 1 was incomplete and that there was more to come.

                                    Now is the appropriate time to develop the explanation in greater depth. First, let us revise what
                                    you may remember from Book 1. Fig A shows how we represented the mechanism of the reaction
                                    between the primary halogenoalkane bromoethane and hydroxide ions.

                                    We must now accept that this mechanism has been made too simple and that we need to consider
                                    two alternative mechanisms. This mechanism shows the movement of two pairs of electrons
                                    happening at the same time — those from the O of OH" ions and those from the C—Br bond. In fact,
                                    there are two distinct mechanisms.

   EARNING OBJECTIVES

@ Understand the nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones and be able to draw their structural, displayed and skeletal formulae.
@ Understand that aldehydes and ketones:
    (i) do not form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and this affects their physical properties
    (ii) can form hydrogen bonds with water, and this affects their solubility.

BONDING
You are familiar with the nature of the C=C double bond in alkenes. It is composed of a combination
of sigma and pi bonding. However, the bond is non-polar because there are two identical (carbon)
atoms involved. The situation in the carbonyl group is very similar, except that the bond is polar
because of the differing electronegativities of carbon and oxygen. Fig A compares the two.




A. figA The bonding in an alkene is on the left. The bonding in a carbonyl compound is on the right. Green is used
    to represent sigma bonding and blue is used to represent pi bonding

Note that the electron density in the pi bond of the alkene is evenly distributed across both carbon
atoms, but that in the carbonyl compound the electron density is greater near the oxygen atom than
near the carbon atom.

are used in expensive perfumes (nonanal, with nine carbon atoms

especially propanone, remind most people of solvents. In fact,
propanone is widely used as a solvent, including as nail varnish
remover.

     ‘ARNING OBJECTIVES

 @ Understand the reactions of carbonyl compounds with:
    (i) HCN, in the presence of KCN, as a nucleophilic addition reaction, using curly arrows, relevant lone pairs, dipoles and
          evidence of optical activity to show the mechanism
    (ii) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH), as a qualitative test for the presence of a carbonyl group and to identify a carbonyl
          compound given data for the melting temperatures of derivatives.
 Be able to use data on optical activity of reactants and products as evidence for addition to carbonyl compounds.



REACTION WITH HYDROGEN CYANIDE
Both aldehydes and ketones react with hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is carried out in an aqueous
alkaline solution containing potassium cyanide (KCN). The equations and mechanisms are the same
for both aldehydes and ketones. Here are some examples of equations.

Addition to propanal:

      CH,CH,CHO + HCN — CH,CH,CH(OH)CN

Addition to butanone:

      CH,COCH,CH; + HCN — CH,C(CN)(OH)CH,CH;

These addition reactions involve a hydrogen atom attaching to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl
group and a cyanide group attaching to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group.

These products contain a carbon atom joined to the functional groups OH and CN. They are named
differently from other organic compounds we have met so far. According to IUPAC rules, the OH group
should be shown as a prefix and the CN group should be shown as a suffix. When this happens, the OH
group is shown as Aydroxy- and not as -ol, and the CN group is shown as the ending -nitrile. In general,
these products are described as hydroxynitriles.

Applying these naming rules:

      CH,CH,CH(OH)CN is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile
      CH;C(CN)(OH)CH,CH; is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

                                        contains an asymmetric carbon atom (a chiral centre), there are equal amounts of both dextrorotatory
                                        and laevorotatory enantiomers formed, giving a product mixture with no optical activity.

                                        Using ethanal as the example, the product is 2-hydroxypropanenitrile. Fig A shows the formation of
                                        a racemic mixture containing equal numbers of both enantiomers.

                                        REACTION WITH 2,4-DINITROPHENYLHYDRAZINE
                                        This compound is sometimes known as Brady's reagent, and its name is often abbreviated as 2,4-
                                        DNPH. You do not need to write equations or mechanisms for any reactions involving this reagent.
                                        However, it is useful to show its structure, and the structure of a product of its reaction with a
                                        carbonyl compound. Fig B shows its reaction with propanal.

                                        The reagent reacts with most carbonyl compounds to form a brightly coloured orange solid (fig C).
                                        This means that the appearance of an orange precipitate is a positive result that indicates the
                                        presence of a carbonyl compound.


                                        MELTING TEMPERATURES OF DERIVATIVES
                                        These reactions with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine give a visual indication of a positive result for the
                                        presence of a carbonyl compound. They can also be used to identify individual carbonyl compounds.
                                        This is because the compounds formed, known as derivatives (because they are derived from
                                        particular carbonyl compounds), can be filtered, purified and dried, and their melting temperatures
                                        measured. These derivatives have the ending -one, so the derivative of butanal is butanal
                                        2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone.

                                        The identity of the original carbonyl compound can often be confirmed by comparing the experimental
                                       values of melting temperatures of these derivatives with data book values. For example, the three
                                        carbonyl compounds pentanal, pentan-2-one and pentan-3-one all have the same boiling temperatures

We met carboxylic compounds briefly in Book 1, as the products
of the oxidation of primary alcohols.                                    methanoic acid                        i

The carboxylic acid group consists of a carbonyl group (C=O)                                           H—C—OH
with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon atom. Both groups

influence each other, so carboxylic acids have some properties
that are not shared with either carbonyl compounds or alcohols.
                                                                                                   ——
The group is usually abbreviated to COOH (and sometimes to
CO.H, although this is not recommended).                                                                   H

The suffix -oic acid is used, with the carbon chain being named in       Propanoic acid                i       ‘        it               fe)

       EARNING OBJECTIVES

 TM@    Understand that carboxylic acids can be prepared by the oxidation of alcohols or aldehydes and the hydrolysis of nitriles.

 TM     Understand the reactions of carboxylic acids with:
        (i) lithium tetrahydridoaluminate(II!) (lithium aluminium hydride) in dry ether (ethoxyethane)
        (ii) bases to produce salts
        (iii) phosphorus(V) chloride (phosphorus pentachloride)
        (iv) alcohols in the presence of an acid catalyst.

If a primary alcohol is used, it first oxidises to an aldehyde, then to a
carboxylic acid, but both oxidations occur inside the apparatus used.

When the oxidation is complete, the reaction mixture is fractionally
distilled to obtain a pure sample of the carboxylic acid.

in hand warmers and to make the additive that gives the flavour to salt and vinegar potato crisps.
An equation for the reaction to make sodium ethanoate occurs between ethanoic acid and sodium

heating is required. An equation for the reaction, using propanoic acid as the example, is:

   CH;CH,COOH + PCI; +» CH;CH,COCI + POCI, + HCl

Acyl chlorides are named using the suffix -oy/ chloride, so this product is propanoyl chloride.
Their general formula is RCOCI.

The phosphorus-containing product is phosphorus trichloride oxide (also known as phosphorus
oxychloride). It is a liquid that mixes with the acyl chloride, which has therefore to be separated by
fractional distillation. The hydrogen chloride gas produced escapes, appearing as misty fumes.

In this reaction, a carboxylic acid is mixed with an alcohol and a small amount of an acid catalyst,
often concentrated sulfuric acid. Even with a catalyst, the reactions are slow and reversible.

                                 WHAT ARE ACYL CHLORIDES?
                                 These used to be known as acid chlorides, and have the general formula RCOCI. They are derivatives
                                 of carboxylic acids, and can be imagined as the result of replacing the OH group in COOH with Cl.
                                 Although they contain a carbonyl group (like carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones), they are not
                                 classed as carbonyl compounds. As with carboxylic acids, having two functional groups sharing
                                 the same carbon atom means that the properties are different from both carbonyl compounds and
                                 halogenoalkanes.

                                 The commonest example is ethanoy! chloride, CH;COCI, which is still called by its old name acetyl
                                 chloride. You may come across others, such as:

                                 REACTIONS OF ACYL CHLORIDES
                                 The carbon atom in RCOCI is joined to two electronegative atoms, and so is electron-deficient
                                 (5+). You can therefore predict that it will be readily attacked by nucleophiles, such as molecules
                                 containing O or N atoms. You need to know about four reactions of acyl chlorides, although no
                                 mechanisms are needed for any of them.

REACTION WITH WATER
Acyl chlorides react vigorously (very actively) with cold water, forming a carboxylic acid and
releasing hydrogen chloride gas, which appears as misty fumes (fig A). The equation for the reaction
of ethanoyl chloride with water is as follows:

                                fe)                                     fe)

REACTION WITH ALCOHOLS
Acyl chlorides react readily with ethanol to form an ester and hydrogen chloride gas. The equation
for the reaction of ethanoyl chloride with ethanol is as follows:

                                                                         (e)

Notice the similarity between these two reactions. In both cases, the H of the second reactant combines
with Cl to form HCl, and the other part of the reactant becomes joined to the carbonyl group.


REACTION WITH CONCENTRATED AMMONIA SOLUTION
Similar to alcohols, acyl chlorides react readily with concentrated ammonia solution. You can now
predict the reaction that occurs: the H of the second reactant combines with Cl to form HCl, and
the other part of the reactant becomes joined to the carbonyl group. The NH, group joined to the
carbonyl group produces a different functional group — amide (not to be confused with amine). The
equation for the reaction of ethanoy! chloride with ammonia is as follows:

                                  fe)                                   fe)
                                  G                                  G
                      CHC               +     NH,   —>      CHC                    +   Ha

                                  cl                                    NH 2

Unlike with water and alcohols, a further reaction occurs. The reactant is a base and the product is an
acidic gas, so these react together to form ammonium chloride:

NH; + HCl > NH,Cl

You could write a single equation that combines both of these reactions:

CH;COCI + 2NH; — CH;CONH, + NH,Cl

You will learn more about amides later in this book.

                                 REACTION WITH AMINES
                                 This reaction is similar to the previous one. A primary amine can be shown as RNH,, so you can
                                 again predict the reaction that occurs: the H of the second reactant combines with Cl to form HCl,
                                 and the other part of the reactant (RNH) becomes joined to the carbonyl group. The equation for the
                                 reaction of ethanoyl chloride with the simplest primary amine, methylamine, is as follows:

                                                             fe)                                    )
                                                           O                                      O
                                                  CHC              +   CH.NH,    —>       CHSC                +   H—Cl

                                                             cl                                       NHCH,

                                 The product of this reaction is a substituted amide, often called an N-substituted amide. The capital
                                 N emphasises that there is an alkyl group attached to N, rather than the usual situation in which it is
                                 attached to another C atom. You can see from the product name (N-methylethanamide) that N- is
                                 used as a locant, in the same way as in names such as 2-methylbutane — it shows where the methyl
                                 group is attached.

                                 Secondary amines (represented as R,NH) react in the same way, although the product will contain
                                 two substituted alkyl groups. A sample equation is:

                                 CH;COCI + (CH;),NH — CH;CON(CH;), + HCl

LEARNING TIP                     The organic product is N,N-dimethylethanamide.

Be sure not to confuse amines    You might be able to predict why this type of reaction does not occur with a tertiary amine (R;N).
(RNH,) with amides (RCONH,).
                                 With three alkyl groups, there is now no H atom to react with Cl to form hydrogen chloride.

                                                                             TOPIC

                                     breaking down (ysis) using water (hydro). It can be considered as the reverse of esterification. You
                                     may remember equations such as this from a previous section:

                                          CH;COOH + CH;CH,OH = CH;COOCH,CH; + H,0.

                                     This shows the formation of ethyl ethanoate from the corresponding carboxylic acid and alcohol. The
                                     reversible arrow indicates that a mixture of ethyl ethanoate and water reacts together to form ethanoic
                                     acid and ethanol. This reverse reaction could be described as the hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate.


                                     HYDROLYSIS IN ACIDIC SOLUTION
                                     We partly covered this type of hydrolysis in the previous paragraph. For a given ester, warming it with
                                     water will cause hydrolysis. As with esterification, the reaction is slow. A catalyst such as sulfuric acid
                                     will speed up hydrolysis, but will not affect the position of equilibrium, so the reaction will not go to
                                     completion:

                                          CH;COOCH,CH; + HO = CH,COOH + CH,CH,OH

                                     HYDROLYSIS IN ALKALINE SOLUTION
                                     The disadvantage of using an alkali such as aqueous sodium hydroxide instead of sulfuric acid is that
                                     the reaction produces a carboxylate salt instead of a carboxylic acid. However, the advantage easily
                                     outweighs this disadvantage — the reaction goes to completion instead of reaching an equilibrium.
                                     The equation for methyl propanoate is:

                                          CH;,CH,COOCH; + NaOH — CH;,CH,COO- + Na* + CH,OH

                                     Converting the carboxylate salt into a carboxylic acid only needs a dilute acid to be added:

                                          CH,CH,COO- + Ht — CH,;CH,COOH

                                     The final organic products are methanol and propanoic acid.

                                     SAPONIFICATION
                                     The Latin word for soap is sapo, so saponification means ‘soap-making’. This is a particular example
                                     of the alkaline hydrolysis of esters. Soaps and detergents have similar uses, but the main difference is
                                     that detergents use organic compounds obtained from crude oil, while soaps use organic compounds
                                     obtained from vegetable (and, originally, animal) sources.

                                     Vegetable oils contain large quantities of triglycerides. These are triesters, each of which consists of
                                     a large ester molecule that can be hydrolysed to one alcohol and three carboxylic acid molecules.
                                     The hydrolysis of a typical triglyceride is shown in fig B.

TM@   Understand how polyesters, such as terylene, are formed by condensation polymerisation reactions.


                                  ADDITION POLYMERISATION
                                  Examples of addition polymerisation were covered in Topic 5 (Book 1: IAS), so may be useful
                                  for reminding you of this type of polymerisation. The monomer propene can combine with many
                                  thousands of other propene molecules to form a very long chain. This process can be represented
                                  as:



                                        HCH,                     HCH,

                                          A This equation represents the polymerisation of propene.

                                  One thing to notice is that all of the atoms in the monomer molecules end up in the structure of the
                                  polymer.


                                  CONDENSATION POLYMERISATION
                                  There are two main differences between addition polymerisation and condensation
                                  polymerisation. In condensation polymerisation:

                                  *     each time two monomer molecules join together, another small molecule is formed

                                  *     usually two different monomers react together.

                                  In many examples of condensation polymerisation, the small molecule formed is water, which is the
                                  origin of the term ‘condensation’. In other examples, the small molecule formed is hydrogen chloride,
                                  but the term ‘condensation’ is still used to describe those examples.

                                  One type of polymer formed in this way is a polyamide, which we will meet in Topic 19.


                                  POLYESTERS
                                  The example we will use to introduce condensation polymerisation is the formation of polyesters.
                                  You will remember that esters are the products of the reaction between alcohols and carboxylic acids.
                                  However, once one molecule of an alcohol has reacted with one molecule of a carboxylic acid, the
                                  reaction is complete. The only organic product is a slightly larger ester molecule.

                                  For a reaction to produce a polymer, we need two monomers, each with two reactive groups (one at
                                  each end). The alcohol usually involved in this type of reaction, more accurately called a ‘diol’, has
                                  two hydroxyl groups, one at each end:
                                                                           H—O—CH—CH—O—H


                                  One of the most common carboxylic acids used (more accurately a dicarboxylic acid) has the
                                  structure below. The common name for this compound is terephthalic acid.



                                                                     H—O—C                            C—O—H
                                                                                 |                    I

                                  Consider how these molecules react together. The OH of the carboxylic acid and the H of the
                                  alcohol react together to form the small molecule, water, and the two molecules are linked together
                                  by an ester group. This equation shows what happens during the formation of a typical polyester

This larger molecule that has formed still has reactive groups at both ends. This means it can
continue reacting with other molecules in the same way as above, until a very long polymer chain

 When showing howa polyester forms, remember that, in the formation of the small molecule, the H comes
 from the diol and the OH from the dicarboxylic acid (or the Cl from the dioyl chloride).

CALCULATING R, VALUES
The chromatogram is analysed and the distance travelled by
the solvent (from the baseline to the solvent front) is measured.
For each component in the mixture, the distance it has travelled
(starting from the baseline) is measured.

The R; value is calculated using the expression:

            _ distance travelled by component

WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Three compounds have these structures:
                     A CH,CH,CH,CH=CH;
                     B   CH3CH(NH,)CN
                     C CH,=CHCOCH;

In a high resolution mass spectrometer, compoundY is found to have an M, value of 70.0423.
What is the identity of Y?

Answer
The molecular formula of A is C;Hio and its M, value is:
                     (5 x 12,0000) + (10 x 1.0078) = 70.0780
The molecular formula of B is C;HgN> and its M, value is:
                     (3 x 12.0000) + (6 = 1.0078) + (2 x 14.0031) = 70.0530
The molecular formula of C is CsH¢O and its M, value is:
                     (4 x 12.0000) + (6 x 1.0078) + 15.9949 = 70.0417
Although none of the calculated M, values exactly matches the accurate M, value obtained from the high
resolution mass spectrometer, the value is much closer to C than to A or B, so compoundY is C.

As each component reaches the detector, a signal is displayed
on the computer screen. Just as retention factor (R;) values can
be obtained from paper and thin-layer chromatography, in HPLC
values of retention time are obtained. The retention time of a
component is the time taken from injection to detection, and these
values can be important in identifying the components. However,
retention times depend on several variables, including:

+    the nature of the solvent

After the sample is injected, the components vaporise and move through the coiled tube with the
carrier gas. They move at different speeds, depending on how strongly they are attracted to the
stationary phase. Those with weaker attractions move more quickly and have shorter retention times.
Fig D shows the separation occurring in the coiled tube.

   LEARNING               TIP
  Traditional column chromatography (using a burette, for example) has one advantage over HPLC and
  GC - reasonable amounts of the components can be collected. In GC the components are often detected
   ina        flame, so they are destroyed during the detection process at the end.

Components are often identified by reference to a database of the
retention times of known substances. However, if a component
has a retention time for which there is no reference, then these

Because HPLC and GC do not give results that are beyond
doubt, they are often combined with a different technique that
you learned about in Topics 2 and 10 (Book 1: IAS). This is
mass spectrometry (MS), a technique that cannot separate a
mixture but which can provide information about the structures
of compounds. The combinations of these techniques are often
abbreviated to HPLC-MS and GC-MS.

PROBLEMS WITH DRUG TESTING
Although the use of GC-MS for detecting small amounts of
banned drugs is usually accepted as producing reliable results,
sometimes a problem arises. One example involves the anabolic
steroid called nandrolone. Anabolic steroids have legitimate uses
in medicine, especially in the treatment of anaemia, osteoporosis
and some forms of cancer. Its effects include muscle growth and
increased red blood cell production and bone density.

Mainly because of their effects in promoting muscle growth,
sporting authorities have prohibited the use of anabolic steroids in
sportsmen and sportswomen, including athletes. When someone              A      fig D A urine sample from an athlete about to be tested for illegal drugs.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Understand that '3C NMR spectroscopy provides information about the positions of °C atoms in a molecule.
Be able to use data from '7C NMR spectroscopy to:
   (i) predict the different environments for carbon atoms present in a molecule, given values of the chemical shift, 5
   (ii) justify the number of peaks present in a '°C NMR spectrum in terms of the number of carbon atoms in different
      environments.



                                WHAT IS SHOWN BY A "°C NMR SPECTRUM?
                                The actual spectrum of a compound is usually shown as a horizontal line just above the horizontal
                                scale, but with vertical lines showing the signals produced by the °C carbon atoms in the molecule.
                                These vertical lines are usually referred to as signals or peaks.
                                 +   The number of vertical lines tells you the number of different chemical environments of
                                     carbon atoms in the molecule, but not necessarily the total number of carbon atoms.
                                 +   The positions of the vertical lines on the horizontal scale tell you the chemical shifts of each
                                     carbon atom and, with reference to a list of chemical shifts, allow you to deduce the chemical
                                     environments.

                                The two isomers of propanol can be used to illustrate these points.

                                 Propan-1-ol has the structure    CH;
                                                                    -—CH,—CH,—OH. Each molecule contains three carbon atoms,
                                all in different chemical environments. You might think that the two carbon atoms in the CH, groups
                                are in the same chemical environment, but they are not. The second one is joined to CH, and CH),
                                but the third one is joined to CH, and OH, which means they are in different chemical environments.
                                There should therefore be three peaks in the spectrum.

                                Propan-2-ol has the structure CH;—CH(OH)—CH,. Each molecule contains three carbon atoms, but
                                those in the two CH; groups are in the same chemical environment. This is because each CH; group
                                is joined to CH(OH). This means that there should be two peaks in the spectrum. Fig A shows the
                                13C spectra of these isomers.

                                 INTERPRETING CHEMICAL SHIFTS
                                 To interpret chemical shifts you need a table of values and corresponding carbon atoms or a chart.
                                 The chart in fig B will be provided in an examination, and you need to become familiar with using it.

We will use this chart to analyse the two spectra for propanol.

Propan-1-ol:

In the spectrum of propan-1-ol the peaks appear at 65, 25 and 10 ppm. The only relevant ranges in
the chart are C—C (the range is approximately 60-0 ppm) and C—OH (the range is approximately
75-55 ppm).

This means that the peak at 65 ppm corresponds to C—OH, so this is the carbon in the CH,OH
group. The peaks at 25 and 10 ppm correspond to C—C, so these are the carbons in the CH; and
CH, groups. Notice that it is not possible to decide whether the peak at 25 ppm is due to the CH; or
the CH, group.

Propan-2-ol:

In the spectrum of propan-2-ol the peaks appear at 65 and 27 ppm. The only relevant ranges in the
chart are again C—C and C—OH.

This means that the peak at 65 ppm corresponds to C—OH, so this is the carbon in the CHOH
group. The peak at 27 ppm corresponds to C—C, so this is due to the carbons in the two CH;
groups. The peak at 27 ppm is bigger than the one at 65 ppm because it is caused by two carbon
atoms, not one.

Fig C shows the interpretation of these two spectra.

                            You need to consider each carbon atom and whether it is uniquely positioned in the molecule or
                            whether there is one or more carbon atoms identically positioned in the molecule.

                            For each of these compounds, predict the number of peaks due to the carbon atoms:

Use the spectrum and the chemical shift chart to explain whether the compound's structure is

Answer
The peak at 5 = 203 ppm is due to a carbon in an aldehyde or ketone.
The peaks at 5 = 37 and 6 ppm are due to a carbon joined to another carbon by a single bond.
This interpretation fits CH;—CH,—CHO but not CH)=CH—CH,OH.
If the structure were CH>=>CH—CH,OH, there would have been a peak in the range 5 = 140-115 ppm
corresponding to C=C, and a peak in the range 6 = 75-55 ppm corresponding to C—OH.

SPECTRUM SHOW?
The actual spectrum of a compound is usually shown as a
horizontal line just above the horizontal scale, but with peaks
produced by the 'H hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The
horizontal scale often starts from 6 = 12.0 ppm on the left to                   integration trace
0.0 ppm on the right. Quite often, only the part of the scale where
the peaks appear is shown.

The peak at 5 = 9.8 ppm is within the aldehyde range, so must be due to the H in the CHO group.

The peak at 6 = 2.4 ppm is within the range for H—C—C=O, so must be due to the two H atoms in
the CH, group joined to the CHO group.

The peak at 5 = 1.6 ppm is within the range for H—C—C (alkane), so must be due to the two H atoms in
the CH, group not directly joined to the CHO group. Note that although the spectrum is for an aldehyde,
the shift for an alkane is appropriate because this CH, group is part of the CH;CH,CH, alkyl group.

The peak at 6 = 1.0 ppm is within the range for H—C—C (alkane), so must be due to the three                                             H

                        TWO MORE POINTS TO REMEMBER
                        +       We have said that protons cause splitting of peaks on adjacent atoms. While this is generally true,
                                it does not apply in cases where the molecule is completely symmetrical. For example, there is
                                splitting of peaks for 1,1-dichloroethane, CHCl,—CHs. The single proton splits the peak for the
                                CH, group into a doublet, and the three protons in the CH; group split the CH peak into a quartet,
                                following the n+1 rule. However, in 1,2-dichloroethane, CH,CI—CH,Cl, neither of the CH, groups
                                affects the protons of the other CH, group because all of the protons are equivalent (the CH,
                                groups are in the same chemical environment).

                        +       Now consider 1-chloropropane, CH;—CH,—CH,—Cl. This time, the two CH, groups are in
                                different chemical environments (so the protons are not equivalent). One is joined to CH; and
                                CH,, and the other is joined to CH, and Cl, so there will be splitting of peaks by the CH, groups.
                                However, this example has been included to make a different point. The first CH, group would
                                be influenced by the CH; group on its left and by the CH, group on its right. Using the n+1 rule,
                                you would make the correct prediction that the CH, and the CH, group acting together would
                                cause splitting into six sub-peaks — this splitting pattern would be described as a sextet. In other
                                compounds, a quintet would be formed by four protons on adjacent carbon atoms — these could
                                be two CH, groups or one CH; group and one proton.


                        PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT, AGAIN!
                        The best way to check how well you understand how to use 'H NMR spectra is to try lots of
                        examples. We will use three examples, all of which require you to use the chart of chemical shifts in
                        Section 15E.7.


                            WORKED EXAMPLE 1
                            Predicting the appearance of a spectrum (chemical shifts and splitting patterns)
                         What would you predict about the appearance of the 'H NMR spectrum of methyl propanoate
                            (CH3;CH;COOCH,)?

                         Answer
                         The CH; in the ethyl group is part of an alkyl group and is joined only to a hydrocarbon (CH;) group, so it
                            should have a peak in the range 8 = 1.8-0.1 ppm, which is split into a triplet because of the two protons in
                            the adjacent CH, group.

                         The CH; in the ethyl group is part of an alkyl group and is joined to a hydrocarbon (CHs) group but also
                            to the C of the COO (ester) group, so it should have a peak in the range 5 = 2.9-1.8 ppm, which is split
                            into a quartet because of the three protons in the adjacent CH; group.

                         The CH; in the methyl groupis joined only to an oxygen atom in the COO group, so it should have a
                            peak in the range 6 = 4.2-2.8 ppm, which is a singlet. This peak is not split because there are no protons
                            on the adjacent atom

Some molecules exist as optical isomers, and living systems showa clear preference for one optical isomer over the other. This is
important for the pharmaceutical industry when designing drug molecules. The following article suggests how the predominance of a
particular isomer may have occurred early in the history of planet Earth.

    A STANDARD ELECTRODE POTENTIAL |
    B REDOX IN ACTION
|

|   In Topic 8 (Book 1: IAS) you learned about one of the main types of reactions:  redox reactions. Now that we
    have studied equilibrium and thermodynamics we can investigate these reactions in more depth. Redox
    reactions keep us alive. They capture the energy of the Sun by photosynthesis, and we can then use that
    energy. However, redox reactions can also kill, because, for example, they can result in explosions. Redox
    reactions are used throughout the chemical industry, for example, to extract metals from their ores. However,
    redox reactions are also responsible for the corrosion of metals. What redox reactions can achieve, they can
    also destroy.

    In Topic 12 we saw that some chemical reactions take place spontaneously. In this topic we will look at the
    branch of chemistry known as electrochemistry, which deals with the use of spontaneous reactions to produce
    electricity.

    In Topic 14, where you developed your knowledge of acid-base equilibria, we saw that a great deal of
    chemistry can be discussed in terms of the transfer of protons. In this topic we will see that another large area
    of chemistry can be understood in terms of the transfer of another fundamental particle, the electron. Proton
    transfer is the basis of acid-base reactions; electron transfer is the basis of redox reactions.

 a high-resistance voltmeter.           There is, however, a further issue to be considered. In the case of magnesium, if the voltmeter

                                        electrode. This means that magnesium is the negative electrode of the cell.

                                        With copper, electrons would flow from the hydrogen electrode to the copper electrode, making
                                        copper the positive electrode of the cell.

The negative sign for Mg?*(aq) | Mg(s) indicates that the equilibrium position of this reaction is
further to the left than the equilibrium position of the reaction in the hydrogen electrode.

The positive sign for Cu*(aq) | Cu(s) indicates that the equilibrium position of this reaction is further
to the right than the equilibrium position of the reaction in the hydrogen electrode.

This is another way of saying that magnesium releases electrons more readily than hydrogen (and
also than copper), but that copper releases electrons less readily than hydrogen.

Magnesium is, therefore, a better reducing agent than both hydrogen and copper. In addition,
hydrogen is a better reducing agent than copper. This point will be developed later in the topic.

SUMMARY
E° values provide a method of comparing the positions of equilibria when metal atoms lose
electrons to form ions in solution.

+     The more negative the £* value, the further the equilibrium lies to the left, i.e. the more readily the
      metal loses electrons to form ions.

*     The more positive (or less negative) the £* value, the further the equilibrium lies to the right, ie.
      the less readily the metal loses electrons to form ions.
Later in this topic we will extend this to include both molecules and ions losing electrons.


ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE
As already mentioned, when we are determining a standard electrode potential, the potential difference
is measured when no electrons are flowing (i.e. no current is flowing) through the external circuit. The
potential difference measured under these conditions is called the electromotive force (emf) of the cell.
The standard emf of a cell is given the symbol £,, and is sometimes called the standard cell potential.

Emf values can be positive or negative, depending on the reference point against which the potential
difference is measured. When measuring standard electrode potentials, the reference point is the
potential of the standard hydrogen electrode, which is set at zero. The emf of a cell in which the
hydrogen electrode is the positive electrode will have a negative value. Similarly, the emf of a cell in
which the hydrogen electrode is the negative electrode will have a positive value.

This now allows us to define standard electrode potential as follows:

The standard electrode potential of a half-cell is the emf of a cell containing the half-cell connected
to the standard hydrogen electrode. Standard conditions of 298 K, 100kPa pressure of gases and
solution concentrations of 1 mol dmTM apply.

SYSTEMS INVOLVING GASES
Suppose we wanted to measure the standard electrode potential of the following redox system:

         7Ch{g) + e° = C(aq)
We can do this by setting up a half-cell in which chlorine gas is bubbled into a solution containing
chloride ions. However, in order to establish an equilibrium between the chlorine molecules and the
chloride ions, and also to provide an electrical connection to the external circuit, we would need to
place a piece of platinum into the solution. Fig D shows the set up.

SUMMARY
The more negative the £* value, the more the equilibrium position lies towards the left - and the
more readily the species on the right loses electrons. The more negative the E* value, the more
powerful the reducing agent.

The more positive the Z* value, the more the equilibrium position lies towards the right — and
the more readily the species on the left loses electrons. The more positive the E* value, the more
powerful the oxidising agent.

      EARNING OBJECTIVES

TM@   Understand that fuel cells use the energy released on the reaction of a fuel with oxygen to generate a voltage.

TM    Know the electrode reactions that occur in a hydrogen—oxygen fuel cell.



                                    HYDROGEN-OXYGEN FUEL CELL
                                   A fuel cell produces a voltage from the chemical reaction of a fuel with oxygen. Several types of fuel
                                   cells have been developed, with the most common type using hydrogen as the fuel (the hydrogen—
                                   oxygen fuel cell). In this fuel cell, hydrogen is supplied externally as a gas, and the cell can operate as
                                   long as the fuel supply is maintained.

                                   Other fuel cells use methanol/ethanol or hydrogen-rich methanol as the fuels.

                                                                    electron flow

                                   At the negative electrode: H,(g) — 2H*(aq) + 2e7.

                                   At the positive electrode: 40,(g) + 2H*(aq) + 2e- > H,O().
                                   The hydrogen ions (protons) pass through the proton exchange membrane, which allows them to enter
                                   the compartment containing the positive electrode, where they can react with oxygen.

                                   The overall cell reaction is:

MANGANATE(VII), KMn0,
Potassium manganate(VII) is a powerful oxidising agent. It is used
for the quantitative estimation of many reducing agents, especially
compounds of iron(II) and for ethanedioic acid and its salts.

In acidic solution, the half-equation for the reduction of the
manganate(VII) ion is:

        MnO;(aq) + 8H*(aq) + 5e~ —* Mn?*(aq) + 4H,O())

In alkaline solution, potassium manganate(VII) yields
manganese(IV) oxide as a brown precipitate, and this interferes
with the end point colour For this reason, therefore, potassium
manganate(VII) is almost always used in solutions that are
sufficiently acidic to prevent the formation of manganese(IV) oxide.

As the titration proceeds, manganese(II) ions, Mn?*, accumulate        A      fig

One of the reasons that your laptops and smartphones are significantly lighter and slimmer than those of ten years ago is not so much
because of advances in computing power but because of advances in rechargeable battery technology.

These are the disposable cells — they are discharged once and discarded
— that for over a century powered small and portable equipment.
                                                                                   Zn(s) + 4NH,(aq) + 2MnO,(s) + 2H,O*(aq)

The most common primary cells are based on the zinc-manganese
dioxide couple: either zinc-carbon cells or alkaline manganese cells.
For a short period, some manufacturers offered mercury cells, which
were replaced by zinc-air batteries, and some companies now produce
3V lithium—Mn0O, cells.

Zinc—carbon
This cell became commercially available in the late 1800s and was
a dry cell version of the original wet Leclanché cell. (The latter was
made up of a conducting solution (electrolyte) of ammonium chloride
with a negative terminal of zinc and a positive terminal of manganese
dioxide.) Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a gel and then sealing             A   fig

  C TRANSITION METALS AS CATALYSTS
  In Book 1 you learned about the Periodic Table, and in particular the elements of Groups 1, 2 and 7. These
  three groups show typical properties of s-block and p-block elements and clear trends in physical and
  chemical properties. For example, in Group 1, the first ionisation energy decreases down the group, and in
  Group 7 the reactivity decreases down the group. You learned to understand simple chemical reactions of
  these elements and their compounds and how to test for ions such as chloride and iodide.

  In this topic, you will learn about transition metals, in particular those in the first row between the s-block
  element calcium and the p-block element gallium. Transition metals have some distinctive properties and uses
  not generally found in s-block and p-block elements, for example:

    the elements have important uses as industrial catalysts

  + they help to remove pollutants from car exhausts

    they are important structural metals, such as iron and copper

    they are used injewellery, especially platinum, gold and silver

    their compounds have bright colours, such as copper(II) sulfate

    they form    ions and compounds with different oxidation numbers, such as iron(II) and iron(III) compounds

    they form complexes, some of which are vital to life, such as haemoglobin, and cis-platin, which is used in
    cancer treatment.

  Many of these properties will be explained, especially those that involve complexes. The term ‘complex’ will
  be carefully explained. Remember that ‘complex’ does not mean ‘complicated’!

                                       far left. On the far right are the noble gases, which are in a group numbered 0 (or sometimes 8). When
                                       you studied periodicity using the elements in Periods 2 and 3, you ignored the big gap between Groups
                                       2 and 3. However, when you look at Period 4 you can see elements between Groups 2 and 4. Some of
                                       these elements are transition metals.

                                       You will also be familiar with the idea of classifying elements as belonging to one of the blocks (s, p, d
                                       or f) of the Periodic Table. The transition metals are in the d-block of the Periodic Table (fig A).
                                       In this topic we will concentrate on the 10 elements in Period 4.

                                       WHAT IS A TRANSITION METAL?
                                       It is easier to list the characteristics of transition metals than to explain fully what they are. To
                                       describe them as being in the d-block indicates only their location and not their characteristics. Most
                                       definitions of a transition metal refer to the electronic configurations of their atoms or ions (see the
                                       Subject Vocabulary for a simple definition).

                                      A fuller definition is quoted in the Edexcel specification:

                                       ‘Transition metals are d-block elements that form one or more stable ions with incompletely filled
                                       d-orbitals.’
    TOPIC 17                                                                                                 185


CHARACTERISTICS OF TRANSITION METALS
Transition metals:
*    are hard solids

«    have high melting and boiling temperatures

*    can act as catalysts

«    form coloured ions and compounds

+    form ions with different oxidation numbers

«    form ions with incompletely filled d-orbitals.

Of the ten d-block elements in Period 4, the first and the last (scandium and zinc) do not have some
of these characteristics. So, although it is correct to describe them as d-block elements, they are not
considered to be transition metals. In particular, each forms only one ion and their compounds are
not coloured.




A.   figB   Transition metals include precious metals such as silver and gold, along
     with familiar metals such as copper, iron and zinc. Each transition metal has more
     than one oxidation state, and their salts form coloured solutions in water.



ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS
THE ELEMENTS
You learned in Topic 2 (Book 1: IAS) how to write the electronic configurations of the elements from
hydrogen to krypton, which includes the ten d-block elements in Period 4. For reference, we show these
in full in table A using the spdf notation, with electrons-in-box diagrams for the electrons in the 4s and
3d orbitals. Copper and chromium do not follow the expected pattern. Where irregularities in the spdf
notation exist, they are shown in red. In the electrons-in-box diagrams, paired electrons are shown with
a green background and unpaired electrons with a blue background.

It is sometimes acceptable to use an abbreviated shorter form of electronic configuration that
represents the complete shells with reference to the previous noble gas. For example, the electronic
configuration of titanium is shown in full as 1s*2s?2p°3s?3p°3d4s’, but can be abbreviated as [Ar]3d?4s”.

THE IONS
When these elements form ions, they lose one or more electrons. Scandium loses both of its 4s
electrons and its only 3d electron, forming the Sc** ion. Zinc loses both of its 4s electrons and none
of its 3d electrons, forming the Zn** ion. Because these two elements form only one ion each, and
these ions have no incompletely filled d-orbitals, they are not classified as transition metals.

                                         When the other eight elements form ions, they lose their 4s electrons before their 3d electrons.
                                         Each element can lose a variable number of electrons, and so forms ions with different oxidation
                                         numbers. The higher oxidation numbers are not found in simple ions. For example, manganese forms
                                         an ion with oxidation number +2 (the Mn?* ion), but the manganese ion with oxidation number +7
                                         is MnOj;, not Mn’*. Transition metal ions involving higher oxidation numbers usually contain an
                                         electronegative element, often oxygen. Table B shows the most common oxidation numbers and
                                         examples of compounds formed.

                                         table B The most common oxidation numbers and compounds for Period 4 transition elements.

                                         You can see that the highest common oxidation number increases from Ti (+4) to Mn (+7) as all
                                         the 4s and 3d electrons become involved in bonding. From Fe to Cu, the increasing nuclear charge
                                         means that the electrons are attracted more strongly and are less likely to be involved in bonding.
                                         Therefore, ions with higher oxidation numbers are less common.

                                   are called ligands. The complete formulae are called complexes. As most complexes have charges,

A COMPLEX EXPLANATION!
Colour is very important in our world — think of traffic lights, paint charts, clothing and the colours
of flowers. There are scientific explanations for colour in plants, paints and dyes. However, these
explanations are often specific to the type of chemical substance being considered.

As far as transition metal complexes are concerned, a full explanation includes three main concepts:
«         the electromagnetic spectrum and the colour wheel
«         the connection between colour, energy and wavelength
«the electronic configurations of transition metal ions.


THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
We first need to find out about the electromagnetic spectrum (fig A). You are probably familiar
with the idea that the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (sometimes described as ‘white
light’) is made up of a mixture of colours (sometimes described as the colours of the rainbow).

A         fig A The diagram shows how the visible part of the spectrum fits into the complete electromagnetic spectrum

So, how many colours make up white light? A traditional answer is seven:
                                   red      orange         yellow        green       blue _   indigo   violet

However, seven is a randomly chosen number, and this list of colours does not contain some that are
now more familiar, such as cyan and magenta.

The real answer is that visible light is made up of a limitless number of colours! If we take red light
to have a wavelength of 700 nm and violet light to have a wavelength of 400 nm, then each precise
value within this range (such as 651.0 and 438.4) represents a different wavelength and therefore a
different colour. There is clearly no limit to the number of values in this range.

                                     THE COLOURS IN A COLOUR WHEEL
                                     Now consider the colours in the visible spectrum shown as a wheel, with the red and violet ends of
                                     the spectrum next to each other There are many different colour wheels with varying numbers of
                                     colours (just try a web search), but fig B shows one that contains seven colours corresponding to
                                     those listed above. Clockwise from the top, they are shown in order from red to violet.

                                     In colour wheels, complementary colours are the colours shown opposite each other. In this one,

                                     red is opposite blue and green. When white light is passed through a solution containing a transition
                                     metal complex, some wavelengths of light are absorbed by the complex. The light emerging will
                                     therefore contain proportionately more of the complementary colour. So, if a complex absorbs red
                                     light, the light emerging will look blue or green (fig C).

                                     A complete explanation of colour or absence of colour, in aqueous solutions of metal ions is quite
                                     complicated. However, the following explanation should help you to understand the basics. We will use
                                     an aqueous solution containing copper(II) ions as an example.

                                     An aqueous solution of zinc sulfate is colourless, but an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate is blue.
                                     As the sulfate ion is present in both solutions we can assume that any difference in colour is caused
                                     by the zinc ions and the copper(II) ions. Zinc and copper are next to each other in the Periodic Table,
                                     so why should copper, but not zinc, form coloured ions?

                                     The electronic configurations of the Zn?* and Cu?* ions are shown in fig D in the electrons-in-boxes

                                   USING ELECTRON PAIR REPULSION THEORY
                                   You already know from Topic 3 (Book 1: IAS) about the use of the electron pair repulsion theory
                                   to predict and explain the shapes of simple molecules and ions. It is quite easy to extend this idea
                                   to predicting and explaining the shapes of complexes. A ligand bonds to the central metal ion by
                                   donating a pair of electrons to form a dative bond. The only differences are that you should ignore the
                                   3d electrons in the transition metal ion and the overall charge on the complex — just count the number
                                   of electron pairs donated by the ligands. Table A shows how this theory can be applied in exactly the

                                   OCTAHEDRAL COMPLEXES
                                   The most common ligands in most octahedral complexes are water, ammonia and the hydroxide ion.
                                   These ligands have different numbers of lone pairs of electrons (ammonia has one, water has two
                                   and the hydroxide ion has three). However each ligand uses only one lone pair to form a coordinate
                                   bond with the transition metal ion. As they contain six ligands, the complexes are sometimes
                                   described as having six-fold coordination. Note that the electron pair donor in each of these
                                   ligands is an element in Period 2 of the Periodic Table, so all three ligands are of approximately
                                   equal size. Table B shows some common examples.

Note that:

+     Solid and striped wedge bonds are used to indicate the shapes, although the 3D shape can be
      shown in other ways.

+    The overall charges are all different — this depends on the charge on the original transition metal
      ion and on how many negatively charged ligands there are.
+     All three structures use square brackets, although these are sometimes left out when the complex
      is neutral.

+    The water ligands are shown as both H,O and OH, — the important point is that the bond must be
      shown to come from oxygen because it supplies the lone pair of electrons for the dative bond.

TETRAHEDRAL AND LINEAR COMPLEXES
These are much less common than octahedral complexes. The only tetrahedral complexes that you
are likely to see in your course are those in which chloride ions act as ligands, such as in the [CuCl,]*~
ion. Note that because chlorine is a Period 3 element, its ions are much bigger than water molecules,
ammonia molecules and hydroxide ions. So, there is usually not enough room around the central
metal ion for six chloride ions to act as ligands.

The only linear complex you are likely to see in your course is the reactive ion present in Tollens’
reagent (sometimes called ammoniacal silver nitrate). An explanation of why the Ag* ion has only
two ligands, and not six, is beyond the aims of this book, but note that silver is a transition metal
in Period 5 (not Period 4) of the Periodic Table. It therefore behaves differently from the transition
metals in Period 4.

Fig B shows the shapes of these two complexes.

      RNING OBJECTIVES

@   Know that square planar complexes are also formed by transition metal ions and that cis-platin is an example of such a
    complex, which is used in cancer treatment where it is supplied as a single isomer and not in a mixture with the trans form.



                                 SQUARE PLANAR MOLECULES
                                 We know that the electron pair repulsion theory can be applied to predict the shapes of simple
                                 molecules and ions. However, you may not have seen an example of a square planar shape. One
                                 example is xenon tetrafluoride, XeF,. Although xenon is a noble gas, it does form some stable
                                 compounds.

                                 An atom of xenon has eight electrons in its outermost energy level, and each fluorine atom uses one
                                 of its electrons to form a covalent bond. The outer energy shell now contains 12 electrons. These are
                                 arranged in six pairs, forming an octahedral arrangement. Two of these pairs are lone pairs, which
                                 repel each other and are therefore located opposite each other. So, the four bonding pairs are in a
                                 plane, with the four fluorine atoms at the corners of a square and an F—Xe-F bond angle of 90°, as
                                 shown in fig A.

                                 cis-PLATIN
                                 Square planar complexes are much less common than octahedral and tetrahedral complexes. One
                                 particular complex of this type, cis-platin, has become well known in recent years because of its use
                                 as an effective treatment for some types of cancer, especially testicular cancer

                                 An explanation of why the four ligands in this complex form a square planar shape, and not a
                                 tetrahedral shape, is beyond the aims of this book. It is not easily explained by the electron pair
                                 repulsion theory. Part of the explanation is that platinum is a transition metal in Period 6, and so
                                 behaves differently from the transition metals in Period 4.


                                 CIS-TRANS ISOMERS
                                 You have learned about E-Z and cis-trans isomerism in Topic 5 (Book 1: IAS). Your understanding
                                 of this type of isomerism can now be applied to inorganic compounds such as cis-platin and its
                                 isomer, trans-platin. These consist of a platinum(II) ion, two ammonia ligands and two chloride ion
                                 ligands.

                                 Fig B shows the structures of these isomers and the relationship between them.

                                  ¢   The cis- prefix indicates that identical ligands are next to each other.
                                  *   The ¢rans- prefix indicates that they are opposite each other.

ANTI-CANCER ACTION
A full understanding of how cis-platin kills cancer cells is beyond the aims of this book. Put simply:

«     All cells, including cancer cells, contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

+     During cell division, the two strands of DNA must separate from each other to form more DNA.

+     The structure of cis-platin enables it to form a bond between the two strands of DNA (fig C),
      which prevents them from separating and so prevents the cancer cells from dividing.

           RNING OBJECTIVES

 TM@    Understand that HO, Cl and NH; act as monodentate ligands

 TM@    Understand the terms ‘bidentate’ and ‘hexadentate’ in relation to ligands, and be able to identify examples such as
        NH,CH,CHNH, and EDTA*
 @      Know that haemoglobin is an iron(II) complex containing a polydentate ligand and that ligand exchange occurs when an
        oxygen molecule bound to haemoglobin is replaced by a carbon monoxide molecule.

 MTM    Understand, in terms of the positive increase in AS.,.tem, that the substitution of a monodentate ligand by a bidentate or
        hexadentate ligand leads to a more stable complex ion.


DENTICITY

Denticity is a rarely used English word, but it is a property of         Having two lone pairs is not enough for a molecule to act as a

When ligands were introduced earlier in this book we could have
                                                                        Occasionally it is abbreviated to ‘en’, especially when used in

Now for bidentate ligands. Bi means two, so a bidentate ligand                LZ
has two atoms, each of which can use a lone pair of electrons to
form a dative bond with the metal ion. You can imagine that a
bidentate ligand has two atoms that can ‘bite’ onto the metal ion.

You can work out for yourself what a multidentate ligand
is — a ligand with several atoms, each of which uses a lone pair
of electrons to form a dative bond with the metal ion. The most
common example you are likely to meet has six such atoms, so it
could be described as a hexadentate ligand.

                                    A carbon monoxide molecule has a lone pair of electrons on its carbon atom that enables it to act as
                                    a ligand. The strength of the dative bond between oxygen and haemoglobin is not particularly strong.
                                    However, the advantage of this is that the oxygen molecule is relatively easily released when it is needed.

                                    Unfortunately, a much stronger dative bond forms between carbon monoxide and haemoglobin.

LEARNING TIP
In 1,2-diaminoethane, there are
only two lone pairs of electrons
in the molecule and both are
used when it acts as a ligand. In
EDTA* the lone pairs of
electrons on the O of the C=O
are not used. Only those on the
N atoms and the negatively
charged O atoms are used.           A fig G These red blood cells contain haemoglobin that transports oxygen from the lungs to the cells in the body.

                                            It is again easy to see that this equation involves a deprotonation — two of the water ligands transfer a

                                            When aqueous ammonia is added to the blue precipitate formed, it dissolves to form a deep blue
                                            solution. The equation for this reaction is:

                                            This is a ligand exchange reaction — four ammonia molecules replace two water molecules and two

                                            good example is the reaction between copper(II) sulfate solution and concentrated hydrochloric acid.

                                            and finally to yellow. This is the equation for the reaction:

                                            is due to a mixture of the blue and yellow complex ions. The solutions at the start and end of the

REACTIONS INVOLVING COBALT COMPLEXES




A. figA The bright colour ofthese glass bottles is caused by blue cobalt compounds.


REACTION WITH ALKALIS
Consider the reaction that occurs when aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to a solution containing
the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion until no further change is seen. The observation is that a pink solution
forms a blue precipitate. The equation for this reaction is:

       [Co(H,0),}** + 20H” — [Co(H,0),(OH),] + 2H,
As with copper, this is a deprotonation reaction — the two hydroxide ions have removed hydrogen
ions from two of the water ligands and converted them into water molecules. The two water ligands
that have lost hydrogen ions are now hydroxide ligands. Upon standing, the colour of the precipitate
gradually changes to pink.

The same observations can be made when aqueous ammonia is used as the alkali. However, when
aqueous ammonia is added to excess, there is an observation not made with aqueous sodium hydroxide —
the precipitate dissolves to form a pale yellow solution. The equation for the deprotonation reaction is:

         [Co(H,0),]** + 2NH; — [Co(H,0),(OH),] + 2NHf

The equation for the ligand exchange reaction forming the pale yellow solution is:

         [Co(H,0),(OH),] + 6NH, — [Co(NH,),?* + 4H,O + 20H-
Some features of transition metal chemistry are impossible to explain without going well beyond
the aims of this book. One of these is why six ammonia ligands are involved in the reaction with
the cobalt complex, while in the corresponding reaction with copper only four ammonia ligands
are involved.

Upon standing, this pale yellow solution changes colour because of oxidation by the oxygen in
the atmosphere. The oxidation number of cobalt increases from +2 to +3, and the darker yellow
[Co(NH,),]** ion forms. Unfortunately, the resulting solution usually looks brown rather than
yellow. This is because other products are formed, from ligand exchange reactions with both water
molecules and any negative ions present.

                                      This reaction is very like the one with the [Cu(H,0),]** ion. When concentrated hydrochloric acid is
                           }y         slowly added to a solution containing the hexaaquacobalt([I) ion, the pink solution gradually changes
                                      to blue. This is the equation for the reaction:

                 r                          [Co(H,0)g}** + 4Cl- — [CoC], + 6H,O

        o                             You can see that all six water ligands have been replaced by four chloride ions. This reaction is also
             4                        an example of a change in coordination number, from 6 to 4. Note that although the charge on the
        oO                            complex has changed from 2+ to 2-, there has been no change in oxidation number.

INTRODUCTION
Some of the reactions of chromium are similar to those we have already met for the ions of copper,
cobalt, iron(II) and iron(II). However, chromium has ions in which the metal has an oxidation number
of +6, so reactions involving these ions must be considered in a different way.

AWORD OF WARNING
We have already discussed that there are an infinite number of colours in the spectrum of visible light,
although we sometimes refer to the seven colours of the rainbow. The perception of colours by humans
varies a lot. A specific colour might be described as pink or purple by different people, and a colour
described as blue-green by one person might be described as blue, green or turquoise by others.

The situation with the colours used to describe chromium compounds is further complicated by
these factors:
+     Some compounds have different colours as solids and aqueous solutions.
«     The colour of a solution depends on concentration.
«     The presence of dissolved oxygen in an aqueous solution can affect the colour observed.

This means that the colours used in this book may not always correspond to those in other books,
and may be different from those observed in test tube reactions that you see.


REACTIONS INVOLVING CHROMIUM(III) COMPLEXES
REACTION OF CHROMIUM(III) COMPLEXES WITH ALKALIS
Consider the reaction that occurs when aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to a solution containing
the hexaaquachromium(III) ion until no further change is seen. The observation is that a green
solution forms a green precipitate. The equation for this reaction is:

         (Cr(H,0),]** + 30HTM — [Cr(H,0);(OH),] + 3H,

    LEARNING TIP
    The colour of the [Cr(NH;),}** ion in a solid, such as chrome alum, is violet. However, when this solid is
    dissolved in water the resulting solution is green, not violet. This is because of ligand exchange reactions
    that occur with the negative ions present.


As with iron(III), this is a deprotonation reaction — the three hydroxide ions have removed hydrogen
ions from three of the water ligands and converted them into water molecules. The three water
ligands that have lost hydrogen ions are now hydroxide ligands.

The same observations can be made when aqueous ammonia is used as the alkali. The equation for
the deprotonation reaction is:

         [Cr(H,0).]** + 3NHs — [Cr(H,0),(OH)3] + 3NHz

EXAM HINT                         When an excess of aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, the green precipitate dissolves to form a
                                  green solution. The equation for this deprotonation reaction can be represented as:
In reactions with transition            [Cr(H,0),(OH);] + OH~ —       [Cr(H,0),(OH),J- + H,0

                                  If the aqueous sodium hydroxide is more concentrated, further deprotonation reactions occur, such as
and ammonia acting as a ligand.         [Cr(H,O),(OH),]” + 20H~ — [Cr(OH),]*> + 2H,O
                                  although there is no further change in colour.

                                  The reactions involving hydroxide ions can be reversed by the addition of acid, illustrating the amphoteric
                                  nature of the neutral complex.

                                  When an excess of aqueous ammonia is added to the green precipitate, the precipitate is slow to
                                  dissolve, but eventually a violet or purple solution forms:

                                        {Cr(H,0),(OH);] + 6NH; — [Cr(NH,).]°* + 3H,0 + 30HTM

                                  In all of the reactions so far, the oxidation number of chromium has remained unchanged at +3.
                                  However, provided that the solutions are alkaline, oxidation is easily achieved by the addition of the
                                  oxidising agent hydrogen peroxide. In this reaction the solution changes from green to yellow as the
                                  chromate(V1) ion, with oxidation number +6, is formed. The equation for this oxidation is:
                                        2[Cr(OH),}°- + 3H,O, > 2CrO}- + 20H- + 8H,O

                                  Note that although the chromate(VI) ion is a complex, it is not enclosed in square brackets.


                                  CHROMATE(VI) AND DICHROMATE(VI) IONS
                                  Chromate(VI) ions are stable in alkaline solution, but in acidic conditions the dichromate(V1) ion
                                  is more stable. So, if acid is added there is a colour change from yellow to orange as the following
                                  reaction occurs:

                                        2CrO} + 2H* = Cr,O7- + H,O

                                  This reaction is easily reversed by adding alkali. When considering redox reactions, it is often easier
                                  to use simplified formulae by leaving out square brackets and ligands that do not undergo redox
                                  reactions, especially water.

                                  REDUCTION OF DICHROMATE(VI) IONS
                                  When zinc metal is added to an acidic solution containing dichromate(VI) ions, reduction reactions
                                  occur in which the oxidation number of chromium decreases first to +3 and then to +2.

                                  The first stage of the reduction involves a colour change from orange to green, as this reaction occurs:

                                        Cr,03?- + 14H* + 3Zn > 2Cr* + 7H,O + 3Zn2*

                                  The second stage of the reduction involves a colour change from green to blue, as this reaction occurs:
                                        2Cr* + Zn — 2Cr’* + Zn?


                                  EXPLANATION OF REDOX REACTIONS USING E° VALUES
                                  It is often helpful to explain why redox reactions occur by considering the standard electrode
                                  potentials of the different redox systems involved. For chromium, we need to consider
                                  these values:

                                  1                  Zn* + 2e° = Zn                        E°=-0.76V

                                  If you have already learned about standard electrode potentials earlier in this book you may
                                  remember that when half-equations are arranged from high negative £° values at the top to high
                                  positive values at the bottom, then the best reducing agent is at the top and on the right, and the best
                                  oxidising agent is at the bottom and on the left.

EXPLAINING OXIDATION FROM +3 TO +6
The simplified equation for the oxidation of chromium(III) by hydrogen peroxide in alkaline
conditions is:

      2Cr(OH); + 3H,0, + 40HTM — 2CrO?- + 8H,O

How can this equation be obtained from the half-equations?

The relevant half-equations are 3 and 4 (see previous page). In these equations, the best reducing
agent is Cr(OH);, and the best oxidising agent is H,O,. For these two species to react together, we
need to add half-equation 3 (reversed) to half-equation 4. When adding half-equations, they may
need to be multiplied so that the number of electrons is the same in both. In this example, we need
to multiply equation 3 by 2, and equation 4 by 3, so as to obtain 6e7 in both:

      2Cr(OH); + 10OH~ = 2CrO}- + 8H,O + 6e~
             3H,O, + 6e- = 60H”

Adding the half-equations and cancelling identical species on both sides gives:

      2Cr(OH); + 3H,0, + 40HTM — 2CrO?- + 8H,O

Since the E* value for half-equation 3 is more negative than the E* value for half-equation 4, Cr(OH);
is electron releasing with respect to H,O,, and therefore the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. If
the solution is then acidified by adding dilute sulfuric acid, the chromate(VI) ion is converted into the
dichromate(VI) ion:

      2CrOF + 2H* — Cr,0?" + H,O

EXPLAINING REDUCTION FROM +3 TO +6
The simplified equation for the reduction of chromium(VI) by zinc in acidic conditions is:

      Cr,OF- + 14H* + 3Zn — 2Cr3*+ + 7H,O + 3Zn?*

How can this equation be obtained from the half-equations?

The relevant half-equations are 1 and 5 (see previous page). In these equations, the best reducing
agent is Zn and the best oxidising agent is Cr,O}~. For these two species to react together, we need to
add half-equation 1 (reversed) to half-equation 6, bearing in mind multiplying half-equations:

                         3Zn = 3Zn** + 6e~
      Cr,0?" + 14H* + 6e~ = 2Cr** + 7H,0

As in the previous example, adding gives:

      Cr,0O?" + 14H* + 3Zn — 2Cr** + 7H,O + 3Zn2*

Since the E* value for half-equation 1 is more negative than the E* value for half-equation 5, Zn is
electron releasing with respect to Cr,O#-, and therefore the reaction is thermodynamically feasible.

EXPLAINING REDUCTION FROM +3 TO +2
The simplified equation for the reduction of chromium(III) by zinc in acidic conditions is:

      2Cr* + Zn — 2Cr** + Zn2*

How can this equation be obtained from the half-equations?

The relevant half-equations are 1 and 2. In these equations, the best reducing agent is Zn and the
best oxidising agent is Cr>+. For these two species to react together, we need to add half-equation 1
(reversed) to half-equation 2, bearing in mind multiplying half-equations:

                 Zn = Zn** + 2e7
      2Cr3* + 2e~   = 2Cr?*

As in the previous example, adding gives:

      Cr+ + Zn > 2Cr* + Zn?*

Since the E* value for half-equation 1 is more negative than the E* value for half-equation 2, Zn is
electron releasing with respect to Cr**, and therefore the reaction is thermodynamically feasible.

                                  Like chromium, vanadium is a transition metal that forms ions with several oxidation numbers.

                                  Unlike with chromium and the other transition elements, the focus here with vanadium is purely on
                                  redox reactions. Vanadium is a good choice for this because there is one distinct colour for each
                                  of the main oxidation numbers found in its compounds. So, it is relatively easy to demonstrate
                                  the change in oxidation number by observing the change in colour during the reaction. As with
                                  chromium, we will consider the feasibility of these redox reactions in terms of E* values. Although
                                  most of the species involved are complexes, and some contain water ligands, the square brackets
                                  and water ligands are left out for clarity.

                                  REDUCING VANADIUM FROM +5 TO +2
                                  The usual source of vanadium with oxidation number +5 is the compound ammonium vanadate(V),
                                  NH,VO;. An acidic solution of this compound contains the dioxovanadium(V) ion, VO,*. When zinc
                                  is added to this solution, reduction begins and there is a gradual colour change from yellow, through
                                  blue and green, to purple as the oxidation number decreases from +5 to +2. All of these colours are
                                  of solutions — there are no precipitates involved. The test tubes in fig A show the colours.

tell you anything about how catalysts work.

its effect on the activation energy of a reaction. You also learned
how to represent catalytic action using Maxwell—Boltzmann

                                TRANSITION METALS AS HOMOGENEOUS CATALYSTS
                                A homogeneous catalyst is one that is in the same phase as the reactants. This means that they are
                                 either all gases, or more often, all in aqueous solution. You have not seen many examples of this type
                                 of catalyst, compared with those that take part in heterogeneous catalysis. Homogeneous catalysis is
                                 also much less common in industry.

                                 The key feature of homogeneous catalysis is the formation of an intermediate species for which a
                                 specific formula can be written.


                                A REACTION OF THE S,02- ION
                                 The ion with this formula has several names, the simplest of which is the ‘persulfate ion’, although it
                                 is often known as the ‘peroxydisulfate ion’. We will not use the IUPAC name, which is very complicated!

                                 It acts as an oxidising agent in its reaction with iodide ions, the equation for which is:
                                       S,02° + 21"      280} +,

                                 One reason why this reaction is slow at room temperature is that the two reactant ions are both
                                 negatively charged and so repel each other. The reaction is much faster in the presence of Fe** ions,
                                 which act as a catalyst. All of the reactants and products, and the catalyst, are in the aqueous phase,
                                 so this reaction is an example of homogeneous catalysis.

                                 STEPS IN THE CATALYSED REACTION
                                 Step 1: The Fe** ions are not repelled by the S,03- ions because they have the opposite charge.
                                 They react together as follows:
                                       S,O%° + 2Fe?* — 2S07- + 2Fe**

                                 Step 2: The Fe** ions formed in Step 1 now react with the I” ions (these also have opposite charges)
                                 as follows:
                                       2Fe** + 21> — 2Fe?* + 1,

                                 The iron(II) ions are used in Step 1 and regenerated in Step 2, so the two steps can repeat continuously.

                                 ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM
                                 The reaction is also catalysed by Fe** ions, for which the following mechanism can be written.

                                 Step 1: 2Fe3* + 21> — 2Fe”* + I,

                                 Step 2: S,O3° + 2Fe** — 2SO} + 2Fe**

                                 The same two reactions are involved, but they occur in a different order.

                                 oxidising agent. For these titrations to work well enough, it is important that the reactions are fast, so
                                 that the end point of the reaction can be accurately observed (fig A).

One example of a redox reaction that can be used in titrations is the oxidation of ethanedioate ions

As with the S,037/I" reaction, the reacting species are both negatively charged. Therefore, the
reaction is slow. However, as more potassium manganate(VII) solution is added, the reaction rate
increases.

         TOPIC 18 ORGANIC
         CHEMISTRY: ARENES
         A ARENES: BENZENE
         Your study of organic chemistry so far has been limited to aliphatic compounds. These are compounds
         containing
                 just unbranched or branched chains of carbon atoms.

         In this topic you will extend your knowledge of organic chemistry by looking at aromatic compounds. These
         are compounds that contain one or more benzene rings. These compounds are also called arenes or aromatic
>        compounds.

         Aromatic compounds play a very important role in helping to keep us healthy. For some people,
         pharmaceuticals mean a better quality of life. For others, they mean the difference between life and death. In
         both cases, aromatic compounds play an essential part. Phenol, for example, is used as a starting material to
         make 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and also paracetamol. Salicylic acid is used to make aspirin.

         Modern transport depends on the products manufactured from aromatic compounds. If all of the components
         of a car, lorry or aircraft made from aromatic-based products were removed, all of those might cease to exist!
         Car body parts, bumpers, dashboards, seats and upholstery are generally all made from products derived from
         aromatic compounds. Synthetic rubbers, also derived from aromatics, give tyres better road-hugging ability,
         especially on wet roads, and also increase tyre mileage.

         Today we want our clothes to be warm, but not thick and itchy. Or we want them to keep us cool, especially
         when we are exercising. We want them to be colourful, but we do not want the colour to fade after a few
         washes. We do not want them to crease after a few hours’ wear, but we do want them to be supple and soft on
         the skin. We want them to be wear-resistant, too.

         All this has been made possible by the new fibres that have been created thanks to the input of the aromatics
         industry. Have a look at the labels on your clothes: acrylic fibres, polyester, nylon. These substances are very
    MH   often added to luxurious fibres such as linen, silk and cashmere wool to give them more resistance to wear.

         Aromatic compounds are used today in most of our sports equipment, from polyurethane footballs to nylon
         parachutes, from light running shoes to polyester swimwear.

         The world as we know it today would be very different if there were no aromatics industry.

 TM    Be able to use thermochemical, X-ray diffraction and infrared data as evidence for the structure and stability of the benzene ring.

 TM    Understand that the delocalised model for the structure of benzene involves overlap of p-orbitals to form 7-bonds.

 TM    Understand why benzene is resistant to bromination, compared to alkenes, in terms of delocalisation of 7-bonds in benzene
       compared to the localised electron density of the 7-bond in alkenes.

BENZENE
The compound benzene is at the heart of every aromatic
compound. So, the first thing we must do is understand what is
special about benzene.

Benzene can be described as an arene, as can many of its derivatives.          Displayed                      Skeletal

                          A NEW MODEL FOR BENZENE
                          The weaknesses of the Kekulé structure and growing evidence from other areas of chemistry led
                          to a new model of benzene. In Book 1, we explained the C=C double bond in ethene in terms of
                          single sigma C—C bonds and pi bonds formed by the sideways overlap of orbitals.

                          Now consider the situation in benzene after all the sigma (a) bonds have formed. Each carbon atom
                          has one electron in a p-orbital. You can imagine the formation of three individual 7-bonds, but instead
                          imagine the formation of one large -bond made up of all six electrons. Three are in a doughnut
                          shape above the atoms and three are in another doughnut shape below the atoms. Together, these six
                          electrons form a delocalised 1-bond, as shown in Fig G.




                          A figG The delocalised structure of benzene forms when the p-orbitals overlap sideways forming a -electron cloud
                            above and below the plane ofthe carbon atoms. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to the cloud, giving a
                                delocalised system of six electrons in total.

 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Understand the reaction of phenol with bromine water and the reasons for the relative ease of this reaction compared
   to benzene.



                               WHAT IS PHENOL?
                               Most aromatic compounds have a benzene ring and an aliphatic part. In previous sections of this
                               topic you have covered some important reactions of the benzene ring. You know many of the
                               reactions of aliphatic compounds from Topic 15 and from Book 1. In this section we will look at
                               one more aromatic compound with a familiar aliphatic group, the hydroxyl (OH) group.

                               Phenol consists of a hydroxyl group joined to a benzene ring. It has some properties similar to an
                               aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol, and you would expect it to undergo electrophilic substitution reactions
                               because it contains a benzene ring. Its structure is:

                                                 OH




                               BROMINATION OF PHENOL
                               You will remember from Section 18A.2 that benzene undergoes bromination, but the reaction needs
                               a catalyst and the reaction mixture has to be heated under reflux. In contrast, the bromination of
                               phenol occurs at room temperature without a catalyst, and works with bromine water. The bromine
                               water is decolourised during the reaction, and the organic product forms as a white precipitate. The
                               equation for the reaction is:

                                       OH                                      OH



                                                 +     3Br,    ——>                     +     3HBr




                                                                               Br

                               Another obvious difference between benzene and phenol is that the substitution reaction occurs
                               three times, as there are three bromine atoms in the organic product. You can probably see why the
                               name is 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The carbon joined to OH is carbon 1, the other carbons are numbered
                               clockwise, and the three bromine atoms are joined to carbons 2, 4 and 6 in the ring.

                               It is beyond the aims of this book to try to explain why the reaction involves substitution by three
                               bromine atoms and not any other number. However, we can try to explain why the reaction occurs
                               much more readily with phenol than with benzene.

USES OF PHENOL AND ITS DERIVATIVES
One of the earliest and best known uses of phenol was in antiseptic surgery, especially by the
surgeon Joseph Lister. Since then, other antiseptics have been developed from phenol. One of the
most familiar of these is the product of the chlorination of phenol - this is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol,
better known as the antiseptic TCP Nowadays, phenol is widely used in many industries, notably in
the manufacture of polymers and pharmaceuticals.


 DID YOU KNOW?
 You will remember phenolphthalein as an indicator in acid-base titrations, and will not be surprised to
 learn that it contains a benzene ring joined to a hydroxyl group! Although you do not need to know its
 structure, notice that its colour change involves a change in the structure of phenol.

PREPARATION FROM HALOGENOALKANES
The method involves heating a halogenoalkane with ammonia. Because ammonia is a gas, this must
be done under pressure and in a sealed container. Alternatively, the halogenoalkane can be mixed
with concentrated aqueous ammonia. The equation for the preparation of methylamine is:

      CH,Cl + NH; + CH;NH, + HCl
The reaction involves nucleophilic attack by the lone pair of electrons of ammonia on the electron-
deficient carbon atom in the halogenoalkane. Notice that the amine formed also has a nitrogen atom
containing a lone pair of electrons. This means that it could also act as a nucleophile, competing
with ammonia in the attack on the halogenoalkane. This would result in the reaction:

      CH,Cl + CH3NH; — (CHs3),.NH + HCl

The product of this reaction is a secondary amine, in this case dimethylamine.

To prevent such unwanted side-reactions occurring, or at least reduce the chances of them
happening, the ammonia is used in excess, so that it outnumbers the molecules of primary amine
formed. Some of the excess ammonia reacts with the acidic hydrogen chloride formed, so a better
equation to represent the preparation is:

      CH;Cl + 2NH; — CH;NH, + NH,Cl

PREPARATION FROM NITRILES
Nitriles can be reduced to primary amines by reduction, using the reducing agent lithium
tetrahydridoaluminate, which you may remember from Topic 15 can also be used to reduce                         Although you can use [H] for the
carbonyl compounds. As before, the reactants are mixed in dry ether, to ensure that there is no water          reducing agent, you must

      CH,CN + 4[H] — CH,CH,NH,                                                                                 number. In this case it is 4[H].
[H] represents hydrogen atoms produced by the reagent in a way that you do not need to know.


PREPARATION OF AROMATIC AMINES                                                                                      nen
A specific method is used to prepare aromatic amines, especially phenylamine, which is made by                    water out       4
the reduction of nitrobenzene. In this method, the reducing agent is tin mixed with concentrated
hydrochloric acid, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux (fig C). The reduction is achieved
partly through the oxidation of tin to tin(II) ions and tin(IV) ions, and partly through the hydrogen
produced in the reaction between tin and the acid. To make things simple we will represent the
reducing agent by [H]. The equation for the reaction is:

      C,HNO, + 6[H] > C,H,NH,
                            + 2H,0
                                                                                                                                        water in
As with other amines, phenylamine is basic and will react with the acid present to form the
phenylammonium ion, but this can easily be converted into phenylamine by adding an alkali such as
sodium hydroxide solution:

      CsHsNH3+ OH” — CsH;NH, + H,0
                                                                                                              nitrobenzene
In the 19th century, phenylamine was called aniline, and was the source of large numbers of dyes
                                                                                                                                            tin
used mainly for clothing. It is still used in the manufacture of synthetic indigo, most familiar as the
colour of blue denim jeans. Nowadays, much phenylamine is used in the manufacture of polymers                                    4 heat

 Note that in the name used for a nitrile, the code indicating the number of carbon atoms includes the C in
 the CN group, so CH;CH,CH,CN is butanenitrile, not propanenitrile.

                                    The first few members of the homologous series of primary aliphatic amines are completely
                                    miscible (capable of mixing) with water. However, as the hydrocarbon part of the molecule becomes
                                    proportionately larger, the solubility decreases.

                                    They dissolve in water because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (see fig A).

                                    Phenylamine is only slightly soluble in water.

                                    You can see the similarity — this is because the nitrogen atom in both molecules can use its lone pair
                                    of electrons to form a dative bond with the hydrogen of a water molecule. The cation in the first
                                    equation is the methylammonium ion — think of it as an ammonium ion in which one hydrogen has
                                    been replaced by a methyl group. So, how do amines and ammonia compare as bases? What is the
                                    position of equilibrium in these reactions?


                                    COMPARING BASICITIES
                                    The basicity (basic strength) of a base can be quantified using the constant K;, or the constant pKj.
                                    The pX, of water at 298K       is 7.00, and any value lower than 7.00 indicates a basicity greater than that
                                    of water. Water is equally good as a base and as an acid. Table A shows the pX, values at 298
                                                                                                                                K for
                                    ammonia and some amines.

                                    What these values show is that methylamine is a stronger base than ammonia, and that extending the
                                    hydrocarbon chain causes further, but smaller, increases in basicity. Phenylamine is a much weaker
                                    base than any of the aliphatic amines, and is a weaker base than even water.

                                    Methylamine is a stronger base than ammonia because the methyl group is electron-releasing, and so
                                    has an increased electron density on nitrogen compared with ammonia. The ethyl and propyl groups
                                    are only slightly more electron-releasing than methyl, so their effects are very similar Fig B shows
                                    the situation.

The equation for the reaction of butylamine with water is

        CH;CH,CH,CH,NH, + H,O = CH;CH,CH,CH,NH; + OH-

The situation with phenylamine is very different. Think back to the diagram in Section 18A.4
showing that in phenol one of the lone pairs of electrons on oxygen is incorporated into the
delocalised electrons in the benzene ring. A similar thing happens with phenylamine, and this
makes the nitrogen less electron-rich and the lone pair of electrons less available for donating to
the hydrogen of a water molecule. Fig C shows how the delocalised electrons now extend above
and below the nitrogen. So, as the original lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is now part of the
delocalised system, it is less available for bonding to the hydrogen of a water molecule.

                                    REACTIONS WITH ETHANOYL CHLORIDE
Addition-elimination reactions      You do not need to know the mechanisms of these reactions. However, the name of the mechanism
are also called condensation        will help you understand how the reactions occur. The reaction type is addition-elimination,
reactions.                          which means that the two molecules join together, and then a small molecule is eliminated — in these
                                    examples, hydrogen chloride. The organic product contains an new functional group — amide — in
                                    which a carbonyl group is next to an NH group.

                                    The equation for the reaction of phenylamine with ethanoyl chloride is:

                                            CH;COCI + CsH;NH,           —    CH,CONHC,H; + HCl

                                    We will meet amides in a later section, but we can introduce the naming system here. The most
                                    common amide is ethanamide, and the product of the above reaction can be thought of as the
                                    result of replacing one of the hydrogens in the NH; group by the butyl group. Its name contains two
                                    words — the first is the alkyl group from the amine and the second indicates the number of carbon
                                    atoms in the original acyl chloride. As the butyl group is attached via a nitrogen atom, Vis used as
                                    the locant. The name is N-butylethanamide.


                                    PARACETAMOL
                                    This is one of the most common pharmaceuticals used to relieve the symptoms of fever and pain.
                                    It is manufactured in a sequence of reactions, one of which is an addition—elimination reaction. Its
                                    structure is:




                                                    N                   OH



                                    You can see how paracetamol got its name. The ‘para’ part indicates that the two groups attached
                                    to the benzene ring are at opposite ends of the ring. The ‘acetam’ part comes from the old name
                                    for ethanamide, which used to be called acetamide. Finally, the ‘ol’ part indicates the presence of a
                                    hydroxyl group.


                                    REACTIONS WITH HALOGENOALKANES
                                    You do not need to know the mechanisms of these reactions. However, you can see that the two
                                    would react together because a halogenoalkane contains an electron-deficient carbon atom and

an amine contains an electron-rich nitrogen atom. Using general formulae, the reaction can be
represented as:

      R'NH, + R"X — R'NHR" + HX

where R’ is the alkyl group in the amine and R’ is the alkyl group in the halogenoalkane. The
reaction is another example of substitution. The organic product is a secondary amine and the
inorganic product is a hydrogen halide, often hydrogen chloride.

The equation for the reaction between phenylamine and chloroethane is:

   CsHsNH, + CH;CH,Cl > C;HsNHCH,CH; + HCl

An example equation using butylamine and chloroethane is:

   CH;,CH,CH,CH,NH, + CH3CH,Cl — CH;CH,CH,CH,NHCH,CH; + HCl

Notice that the organic product also contains an electron-rich nitrogen atom, so it can also react with
chloroethane. The equation for this further reaction is:

   CH;,CH,CH,CH,NHCH,CH; + CH;CH,C] — CH;CH,CH,CH,N(CH,CH,), + HCl

The organic product of this reaction is a tertiary amine.

Once again, the tertiary amine contains a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, which can also
react with the halogenoalkanes. The equation for this further reaction is:

   CH;CH,CH,CH,N(CH,CH,), + CH3CH,Cl + CH;CH,CH,CH,N*(CH,CH,)3CI

Note that the equation is different this time — HCl is not formed because this would require the loss
of H from the nitrogen of the organic reactant, which a tertiary amine does not have. The product
is an ionic compound related to ammonium chloride (NH{CI), except that all the hydrogens in the
ammonium ion have been replaced by alkyl groups. It is known as a quaternary ammonium salt.

Reaction with halogenoalkanes does not seem to be a good method of preparation, as it is likely that
a mixture of similar products will be formed. If there is an excess of the halogenoalkane, then the
sequence of all four reactions is more likely to occur. Producing a quaternary ammonium salt in this
sequence is what happens in industry. These compounds have many uses, and are usually found in
fabric softeners.


REACTIONS WITH COPPER(II) IONS
You will remember from Topic 17 that ammonia can act as a lone pair donor in its reactions with
transition metal ions. This is the overall equation for its reaction with hexaaquacopper(II) ions:

   [Cu(H,0),}** + 4NH; — [Cu(NH3),(H,0O),]** + 4H,O

Amines also have a lone pair of electrons on nitrogen, so can take part in similar reactions. The           LEARNING TIP

FORMATION OF AZO DYES
REACTION OF PHENYLAMINE WITH NITROUS ACID
Nitrous acid is a very unstable compound. It exists only in aqueous solution and decomposes at
room temperature. This means that any reactions involving nitrous acid have to be carried out under
very carefully controlled conditions. The nitrous acid must be prepared in situ by mixing ice-cold
solutions of sodium nitrite and dilute hydrochloric acid. The equation for the reaction is:

     NaNO,(aq) + HCl(aq) + NaCl(aq) + HNO,(aq)

                              This reaction is called a coupling reaction. The compound formedis an energetically stable, yellow
                              azo dye. Its stability comes from extensive delocalisation of electrons via the nitrogen-to-nitrogen
                              double bond. If you examine the structure you can see how the double and single bonds alternate.
                              Systems of alternating double and single bonds are called conjugated systems. Where extensive
                              conjugation occurs, absorption of light takes place, so the compound is coloured.

                              The dye (4-hydroxypheny])azobenzene is just one of the wide range of dyes that can be made from
                              aromatic amines and other arenes. These are known as azo dyes. They are very stable, so they do
                              not fade. Another example is the acid-base indicator methyl orange, which has the structure:

                                          Note that ammonia is basic and that the inorganic product is acidic, so there will be a reaction
                                          between the two molecules:

                                              NH; + HCl > NH,Cl

                                          So, a better overall equation for the reaction, combining these equations, is:

                                          POLYAMIDES
                                          In Topic 15 we learned about polyesters as examples of polymers formed by condensation
                                          polymerisation reactions. The formation of these polymers needs two monomers — a dicarboxylic
                                          acid and a diol. The formation of polyamides also needs two monomers — a dicarboxylic acid and
                                          a diamine.

                                          The simplest examples of a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine are HOOCCOOH and H,NCH,NH;. You
                                          can see how these molecules can react together — one has acidic groups and the other has basic groups,
                                          so they can react with each other to form a CONH group with the elimination of H,O.

                                          Nylon is almost certainly the most familiar example of a polyamide. Both of the monomers
                                          used in the production of its most common form contain six carbon atoms. Common examples
                                          of these monomers are hexanedioic acid (known as adipic acid in the polymer industry) and
                                          hexane-1,6-diamine (also known as 1,6-diaminohexane). Both of these monomers have the same

                                          PROPERTIES OF POLYAMIDES
                                          The majority of polyamides (nylons) tend to be semi-crystalline. They are generally very tough
                                          materials with good thermal and chemical resistance. Polyamides tend to absorb moisture from

their surroundings. This absorption continues until equilibrium is reached. In general, the impact
resistance and flexibility of polyamides tends to increase with moisture content, while the strength
and stiffness decrease.

The strong bonds in polyamides make the polyamide chains themselves strong. Polyamides such as
nylon can be made into strong fibres for making clothing, fishing lines and carpets. Kevlar® is also a
polyamide.

Polyamide film (cling film) is used for food packaging because of its toughness and because gas
molecules do not pass through it easily. Polyamide film is also used for ‘boil-in-the-bag’ food
packaging because of its high temperature resistance.

Polyamides tend to provide good resistance to most chemicals. However, they can be attacked
by strong acids and alkalis. This is because they contain the amide link (peptide link), which is
hydrolysed by acids and alkalis (see Section 19A.6).


POLY(PROPENAMIDE)

In Topic 5 (Book 1: IAS) you learned about addition polymerisation. This is when many molecules
(monomers) with double bonds join together to form a long-chain molecule (polymer). In this
reaction, one of the bonds in the double bond is broken and the monomers are linked together by
single bonds. The most common example of this is the formation of poly(ethene) from ethene:

Poly(propenamide) is an addition polymer. It is formed by polymerising 2-propenamide (sometimes
called acrylamide):

The polymer is used as a thickener and as a filler in facial surgery. It is also used in water treatment
and papermaking.

The polymer chains in poly(propenamide) can be easily cross-linked with other chains. The resulting
polymer with cross-chains produces a thick gel that has a larger capacity to absorb water. It can be
used for making soft contact lenses (fig C).                                                               A fig   Soft contact lenses are

POLY(ETHENOL)
Poly(ethenol) is another addition polymer. It is sometimes called poly(vinyl alcohol). It is not
manufactured in the usual way by directly polymerising a monomer Instead it is made in two stages.

The first stage is the polymerisation of ethenyl ethanoate:

                        In the second stage, poly(ethenyl ethanoate) is reacted with methanol to form poly(ethenol) and
                        methyl ethanoate, in a process called ester exchange:

                        The amount of ester exchange can be controlled by altering the temperature.

                        Poly(ethenol) molecules contain many OH groups. These groups can form hydrogen bonds with
                        water, and so the polymer can be made to be soluble in water. The exact solubility of the final
                        polymer depends on the percentage of ester groups that have been replaced by OH groups. The
                        solubility can range from insoluble, to soluble in hot/warm water, to soluble in cold water.

                        Poly(ethenol) is used to make disposable laundry bags for use in hospitals. The laundry bags are soluble
                        in water. Dirty bedding and clothes that may be covered in microorganisms from patients are put into
                        the laundry bag. The bag is then placed into a washing machine without the hospital workers touching
                        the dirty fabrics. During washing, the bag dissolves completely and the fabrics are washed clean.

                        Poly(ethenol) is also used to make liquid-detergent capsules (liquitabs) that contain measured
                        quantities of detergent for use in washing machines and dishwashers. The bags dissolve in the water.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 TM@ Understand the nomenclature of amino acids and be able to draw their structural, displayed and skeletal formulae.
 TM@ Be able to describe experiments to investigate the characteristic behaviour of amino acids limited to:
    (i) acidity and basicity and the formation of zwitterions
       (ii) effect of aqueous solutions on plane-polarised monochromatic light.



WHAT ARE AMINO ACIDS?
The name suggests the presence of an amino group and a carboxylic acid group. Unlike amides,
these two groups are separated by a carbon atom and so retain most of their typical properties.
Below is the general displayed formula of an amino acid.

WhenR       (the symbol for an alkyl group) is only a hydrogen, the amino acid is the simplest one,
glycine. Over 20 amino acids are found in humans. Some of these are synthesised in the body,
and others must be included in the diet. Proteins are made from amino acids, and these will be
considered in the next section. Although R is normally used to represent an alkyl group, in the case
of amino acids it can represent a more complex structure. Table A shows information about some
important amino acids.

There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids. They are often referred to as 2-amino acids because
the NH, is attached to the second carbon atom in the chain, counting the C in COOH as carbon 1.
Note that most amino acids have one NH, group and one COOH group, although some have two of
one and one of the other.

NOMENCLATURE
Although amino acids are usually referred to by their common names, such as glycine, H]NCH,COOH,
and alanine, H,NCH(CH;)COOH, they also have systematic names using the rules defined by IUPAC.
They are named as amine derivatives of carboxylic acids, using the prefix amino to indicate the
presence of the amine group, NH,. A locant is used to indicate the position of the amine group in the
carbon chain of the carboxylic acid.

Table B shows the structural formulae and names of some amino acids. The 3-amino acids are not
naturally occurring.

ACIDIC AND BASIC PROPERTIES
The values of the isoelectric points of the amino acids have been included to help you understand
their acid-base character. They are all soluble in water, and you can imagine that one of two reactions
might occur. The molecule could act as a base and form an alkaline solution in a reaction like this:

      H,N—CHR—COOH + H,O = H,N*—CHR—COOH + OH
 TOPIC 19

Alternatively, it could act as an acid and form an acidic solution in
a reaction like this:

 H,N—CHR—COOH + H,O = H,N—CHR—COO>                                  + H,O*

There is a third alternative — an H* ion could transfer from the
COOH group to the NH, group in a reaction like this:

   H,N—CHR—COOH = H,N'—CHR—COO

The product of this reaction is electrically neutral because it has
a positive charge and a negative charge that balance each other.
Such species are called zwitterions. Zwitter is the German word
for hybrid, meaning a cross between two things and having the
characteristics of both.

        RNING OBJECTIVES

TM@   Be able to draw the structural formulae of the repeat units of proteins.
TM    Be able to describe experiments to investigate the characteristic behaviour of amino acids in the formation of peptide bonds
      by condensation polymerisation.



                                    WHAT IS A PEPTIDE?
                                    When two amino acid molecules react together, an acid-base reaction occurs. The OH of the COOH
                                    group combines with one of the H atoms of the NH, group to form water. This is a condensation
                                    reaction, in which the two amino acids are joined together by an amide group (CO—NH). The bond
                                    that forms is known as a peptide bond, and the organic product is a dipeptide.


                                    MORE THAN ONE DIPEPTIDE
                                    When two amino acids combine together to form a dipeptide, there are always two possibilities —
                                    sometimes more. For example, when glycine reacts with alanine, the OH could be lost from either
                                    molecule, as shown below.

                                    TRIPEPTIDES
                                    When one molecule of each of three different amino acids reacts together to form a tripeptide, the
                                    six possibilities can be summarised using the three-letter abbreviations shown in the table in the
                                    previous section. They are:

                                    ala—cys-glu      ala—glu-cys          cys-ala-glu     cys-glu-ala      glu-ala—cys       glu-cys—ala
                                    If you work out the possibilities in which two or more molecules of the same amino acid in these
                                    three react to form a tripeptide you will find that there are many more!


                                    POLYPEPTIDES AND PROTEINS
                                    Polypeptides and proteins are formed by condensation polymerisation of many amino acids. The
                                    main difference between a long-chain polypeptide and a protein is that proteins have further levels
                                    to their structures. These are to do with the way in which the polypeptide chains interact with each
                                    other in three dimensions, to give secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures, but these are beyond
                                    the aims of this book.


                                    ANALYSING PROTEINS
                                    Many proteins have very large molar masses and complex structures. In recent decades, more and
                                    more proteins have been analysed. As several million different proteins are thought to exist, this work
                                    is still continuing but far from complete. Table A shows three examples of proteins, the first two of
                                    which have vital roles in the human body.

You can see that this hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the original dipeptide formation, except that

The different types of chromatography are covered in Topic 15, and you already know about
simple chromatography from your previous study of chemistry. A mixture of amino acids produced
by hydrolysis of a protein can be spotted onto chromatography paper. Using a suitable solvent,
the individual amino acids will rise to different heights during the experiment. As amino acids are
colourless, the chromatogram can be sprayed with a developing agent so that the positions of the
amino acids can be seen. You may read about the use of ninhydrin as a developing agent. Although
this works well, ninhydrin is not normally used now because of its toxic nature.

    Remember that separating amino acids using chromatography depends on the relative solubilities of the amino
    acids in the mobile and stationary phases. It does not depend   on the size of the amino acids (see Topic 15).

The science behind protein structures has come a long way since the first protein structure, myoglobin, was solved by Kendrew and
Perutz in 1958. Developments in the knowledge of how proteins fold have since led to the development of ‘designer’ proteins.

        ORGANIC
SYNTHESIS

In organic chemistry so far you have learned about the reactions of a number of functional groups, such as
alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, esters, amines and amides.

In this topic you will learn how to use your knowledge of these reactions to produce a reaction synthesis for an
organic compound. You will also learn about the various techniques used in the preparation and purification
of organic compounds, such as refluxing, solvent extraction, recrystallisation and distillaton.

Perhaps the most important use of organic synthesis is the production of medicines. People have used ‘natural’
medicines obtained from plants and herbs for thousands of years. During most of that time they had no idea
how or why the medicines worked. The effectiveness of the plants or herbs was discovered by trial and error,
and sometimes there were disastrous mistakes.

Today's synthetic medicines are increasingly designed to have specific effects, something that is becoming
easier as we learn more about the body's chemistry. Aspirin and paracetamol are perhaps two of the best
known and earliest medicines to have been synthesised. Today there are thousands of synthesised medicines
to help combat all types of illnesses and diseases, ranging from antibiotics, to cure illnesses caused by bacteria,
to statins, which help to lower the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood.

Who knows! Maybe one day you will be involved in the synthesis of a life-saving medicine.

compound in Topic 1 (Book 1: IAS).                                     we can then work out the following:

                                                                       *   mass of carbon dioxide — mass of carbon — % carbon
To find the empirical formula from the percentage composition
by mass of the elements you must first divide the percentage           *   mass of water — mass of hydrogen — % hydrogen

divide the values obtained by the smallest value. The numbers you
obtain should give you an obvious whole number ratio.                   WORKED EXAMPLE 2

This worked example will remind you of the method.                      2.90 g of an organic compound, containing carbon, hydrogen and
                                                                        oxygen only, was burned in excess oxygen.

Answer                                                                                1.80                   :

      C (40.00 = 12.0) = 3.33
      H (6.67 = 1.0) = 6.67                                             2.70 g of water contains 22 x 2.70 = 0.30 g of hydrogen.
      O (53.33 = 16.0) = 3.33
                                                                           % hydrogen = 290 * 100 = 10.3%
 Dividing all three numbers by the smallest (i.e. 3.33) gives the
 following ratio:
                                                                           % oxygen = 100 - (62.1 + 10.3) = 27.6%

(b) Z reacts with HCl, so it contains an amine group (-NH)).
   Z reacts with NaOH, so it contains a carboxylic acid group
   (-COOH).
   There is one -NH2 group per molecule and one -COOH per
   molecule (one mole of Z reacts with both one mole of HCI and
   one mole of NaOh).
   Z can form a zwitterion, so it must be an amino acid.
   The structure of Z is HINCH,COOH.

   Z is produced by hydrolysis of Y. ¥ must therefore be an amide.

   Since there is only one organic product, the structure of ¥ must
   be HJNCH,CONHCH,COOH.

  LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 Understand methods of increasing the length of the carbon chain in a molecule by the use of magnesium to form Grignard
    reagents and the reactions of the latter with carbon dioxide and with carbonyl compounds in dry ether.

 Be able to use knowledge of organic chemistry to solve problems such as:
     (i) predicting the properties of unfamiliar compounds containing one or more of the functional groups included in
           the specification and explain these predictions
    (ii) planning reaction schemes of up to four steps, recalling familiar reactions and using unfamiliar reactions given
           sufficient information.

a halogenoalkane into an alcohol. In this section we will consider            all the reactions, but that would probably be too complicated to

GRIGNARD REAGENTS
Victor Grignard was a French chemist who devised a new way to synthesise organic compounds.
His method involved the use of organometallic compounds containing magnesium, which are now
known as Grignard reagents. They are made by heating under reflux the chosen halogenoalkane
with magnesium in a solvent of dry ether Halogenoarenes such as bromobenzene are also
used. Bromoalkanes are used in preference to other halogenoalkanes. Grignard reagents contain
magnesium covalently bonded to both the alkyl group and the halogen. A general equation for the
formation of a Grignard reagent is:

       R—Br + Mg — R—Mg—Br

Grignard reagents react with water, so they are both made and used in a solvent of dry ether.


GRIGNARD REACTIONS
Once a Grignard reagent has been made it can then be converted into a range of organic
compounds, depending on the reagent used. In this book we will consider only two of these
reactions: with carbon dioxide and with carbonyl compounds. They can be summarised as follows.

R, R’ and R" represent different alkyl groups, although they could be the same. Note that both
carbon dioxide and methanal increase the carbon chain by one carbon atom. Both aldehydes and
ketones produce a branch, of variable length, on the existing carbon chain.

Having made the appropriate Grignard reagent, the second reagent (carbon dioxide or the carbonyl
compound) is added. After the reaction is complete, a dilute acid is added to obtain the desired
organic product.

MULTI-STEP SYNTHESES
You may be asked to plan to a reaction scheme that shows all the intermediate compounds as well as
the reagents and conditions required for each step. There are several ways you can approach this:

*     by checking if the carbon chain length has increased or decreased

«by looking at the final product and ‘working back’ to the starting compound

«by looking at the starting compound and thinking of the types of reactions it can undergo.

Fig D shows how working back can be used to plan the synthesis of one compound from another. In
this case the starting compound is bromoethane and the final compound is ethanoic acid:

A      figD

You can plan the reaction scheme using the following stages.

«     Begin by writing the formulae of the compounds that can be readily converted into ethanoic acid.
      These include ethanenitrile, ethanol, methyl ethanoate and ethanol.

+     Now look at the starting compound, bromoethane, to see if it can be converted into one of these
      compounds. If necessary, write the formulae of the compounds that bromoethane can easily be
      converted into. These include ethanol, ethene and ethylamine.

*     You should now be able to see a clear two-step route from bromoethane to ethanoic acid. In this case,
      the route is to convert bromoethane into ethanol, and then to convert ethanol into ethanoic acid.

«     Finally, you need to add the reagents and conditions required for each step. To convert
      bromoethane into ethanol you need to add aqueous sodium hydroxide and heat under reflux.
      To convert ethanol into ethanoic acid you need to add potassium dichromate(V1) and dilute
      sulfuric acid and heat under refiux.

You can set out your final answer as shown in fig E:

                 Answer

                 Working backwards
                 The final compound is an N-substituted amide (a secondary amide). It can be made by the reaction between an
                 amine and an acyl chloride, at room temperature. In this case, the reactants are phenylamine, CgHsNH,, and ethanoyl
                 chloride, CH;COCL.
                 Phenylamine can be made by heating nitrobenzene, CzH;NO,, under reflux with tin and concentrated hydrochloric acid

                 Working forwards
                 Benzene, C,H,, is converted into nitrobenzene by heating under reflux at 50-60 °C with a mixture of concentrated
                 nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid.

                 The three-step synthesis is therefore:
                                                                   NO,                             NH,                              NHCOCH,

                                   50-60°C

                               Deduce the reagents and conditions, and identify the three intermediates, in the four-step synthesis of
                               ethanol, CH;CH,OH, from methanol, CH;0H

                               Answer

                               The first point to note is the increase in carbon chain length from 2 to 3. You have seen three methods
                               for increasing the carbon chain:
                               *   reaction between a halogenoalkane and KCN
                               +   reaction between an alkene and HCN.
                               +   the use of Grignard reagents.

                               We are going to look at how to do this conversion without the use ofa Grignard reagent.

                               Working backwards
                               There are several ways of making ethanol. For example:
                               +   hydrolysing chloroethane, CH;CH,Cl, or bromoethane, CH3;CH,Br
                               +   reducing ethanal,    CH;CHO
                               +   reducing ethanoic acid, CH;COOH.

                               Ethanoic acid can be made by hydrolysing ethanenitrile, CH;CN.

                               Converting a halogenoalkane into a nitrile is one method of increasing the carbon chain. CH3CN can
                               be made by reacting CH;Cl with KCN.

                               Working forwards
                               CH3OH can be converted into CH;Cl by reaction with PCls.

                               A possible four-step synthesis is therefore:
                                                   dry PCI,
                                   CH,OH                  -      CH,CI           nen           CH,CN

                                SAFETY IN CHEMISTRY LABORATORIES
                                Incidents that cause harm to people are rare in school and college chemistry laboratories. One
                                of the reasons for this is that all laboratories must consider the hazards of carrying out chemistry
                                experiments and use safe methods of working.

                                This applies to all chemistry experiments, whether you are given the instructions for doing them,
                                or whether you plan your own. When you plan an organic synthesis you must consider the hazards
                                associated with the reactants, the substance you are synthesising and with any intermediate
                                compounds formed.


                                HAZARDS, RISKS AND CONTROL MEASURES
                                The hazards of chemical substances relate to the inherent properties of each substance and the way
                                in which it will be used. Most people would consider that water (H,O) is completely safe and has no
                                hazards. In most situations this is the case. However, consider a beaker of boiling water. The steam
                                coming from the boiling water, and the boiling water itself, could both cause harmful effects if they
                                came into contact with your skin.

                                Now consider a substance that most people would consider dangerous. You probably used dilute
                                hydrochloric acid years ago in experiments involving marble chips. You will have been told to wear
                                eye protection when using the acid, because of the harm it could do if it got into your eyes.

                                The hazard exists because hydrochloric acid is corrosive.

                                The risk is that hydrochloric acid may get into your eyes and cause harm.

                                The control measure is to wear eye protection to reduce the risk of the acid getting into your eyes.

                                This simple example should help you to understand the difference between hazard and risk — these
                                two words are often thought, wrongly, to have the same meaning.


                                HAZARD WARNING SYMBOLS
                                A long time ago, bottles containing certain chemicals were labelled with the word POISON. This
                                early attempt to prevent harm to laboratory workers was well intentioned, but some people may have
                                thought that bottles without such a label contained harmless substances.

                                More recently, symbols (sometimes called pictograms) have been used as labels for bottles to identify
                                the actual hazard of the substance inside. The actual symbols have changed over the years, and you
                                may still see older ones used, especially those in squares with an orange background, such as these:




                                The symbols in current use are red diamond shapes. Table A shows some of the more common.

that they will escape from the reaction mixture during the heating
process. The normal way to prevent this happening is to heat the
reaction mixture in a flask fitted with a reflux condenser (fig A). This
technique is also known as refluxing. All the vapours rising from the
reaction mixture during heating enter the condenser and change
back into liquids. They then return to the fiask so that the unreacted
compounds can react.

that forms a separate layer (fig C). The agitation of the liquid
caused by the steam bubbling through the mixture ensures that
both the insoluble liquid and the aqueous solution are on the
surface of the mixture and so can form part of the liquid that
evaporates. The advantage of this process is that the insoluble
liquid is removed from the reaction mixture at a temperature
below its normal boiling temperature.

An example is phenylamine, a liquid with a boiling temperature of
184°C. During steam distillation of a reaction mixture containing
phenylamine, a liquid containing phenylamine and water distils
at a temperature of 98 °C. An advantage of doing this is that the
temperature at which phenylamine distils is much lower than its
boiling temperature, so there is less chance of decomposition.

                                SOLVENT EXTRACTION
                                As the name suggests, this method involves using a solvent to remove the desired organic product
                                from the other substances in the reaction mixture. Several solvents can be used, but the choice
                                depends mainly on these features:
                                *   The solvent added should be immiscible (i.e. does not form a mixture) with the solvent containing
                                    the desired organic product.
                                    The desired organic product should be much more soluble in the added solvent than in the
                                    reaction mixture.

                                The method is this:
                                «   Place the reaction mixture in a separating funnel (fig A), and then add the chosen solvent — it
                                    should form a separate layer
                                +   Place the stopper in the neck of the funnel and gently agitate the contents of the funnel for a short
                                    while (put a finger on the stopper, invert, open the tap, agitate in a circular motion, close the tap
                                    and return the funnel to its normal position).

                                +   Allow the contents to settle into two layers.
                                +   Remove the stopper and open the tap to allow the lower layer to drain into a flask, and then do the
                                    same to allow the upper layer to drain into a separate flask.

                                If a suitable solvent is used and the method is followed correctly, most of the desired organic product
                                will have moved into the added solvent. It is better to use the solvent in small portions rather than
                                in a single volume (e.g. four portions of 25 cm? rather than one portion of 100 cm’) because this is
                                more efficient. Using more portions of solvent, but with the same total volume, removes more of the
                                desired organic product.

                                The desired organic product has been removed from the reaction mixture, but is now mixed with the
                                added solvent. Therefore, simple distillation or fractional distillation must now be used to separate
                                the desired organic product from the solvent used.

WASHING
You might assume that washing is a technique used to remove impurities from a solid. Although
this is correct, it is also used to remove impurities from a liquid. Washing could involve the use of
water or an organic solvent. It could also involve the use of sodium carbonate solution, to remove
any excess acid that may be present. Whichever liquid is used, it must be chosen carefully so as to
dissolve the impurities but as little as possible of the substance being purified.

An impure solid is stirred in some of the solvent, then the mixture is filtered. If the solid is already in
a filter funnel, the solvent could be added on top of the solid.

A liquid would be mixed with a solvent chosen so that it will dissolve little, if any, of the liquid to be
purified. The mixture is then shaken in a separating funnel. After allowing the two liquid layers to
separate, the tap is opened to allow each layer to drain into a separate container.

DRYING
No special technique is needed to dry an organic solid — it just needs to be left in a warm place or in
a desiccator with a suitable drying agent (fig B).

                                    drying agent


A.   figB   Drying an organic solid in a desiccator

Many organic liquids are prepared using inorganic reagents, which are often used in aqueous
solution. A liquid organic product may partially, or even completely, dissolve in water. Therefore,
water may be an impurity that needs to be removed by a drying agent. Obviously, one important
feature of a drying agent is that it does not react with the organic liquid.

Several drying agents are available, but the most common ones are anhydrous metal salts — usually
calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate. The property that these compounds have in
common is that they form hydrated salts. So, when they come into contact with water in an organic
liquid, they absorb the water as water of crystallisation.

The drying agent is added to the organic liquid and the mixture is gently agitated or shaken, and
then left for a period of time. Before use, a drying agent is powdery, but after absorbing water it looks
more crystalline. If a bit more drying agent is added and remains powdery, then this is an indication
that the liquid is dry. The liquid also goes from cloudy to clear when water is removed.

The drying agent is removed either by decantation (pouring the organic liquid off the solid drying
agent) or by filtration.

FILTRATION
Itis likely that after preparation, an organic solid will need to be filtered at some stage. This always
happens as part of recrystallisation, so the two pieces of apparatus (Buchner and Hirsch funnels) that
are normally used will be considered under the next heading. The use of a vacuum pump means that
these methods are described as filtration under reduced pressure.

RECRYSTALLISATION
When an organic solid has been prepared, it is likely to need purification. A traditional way of removing
impurities is the technique of recrystallisation. The principle behind this technique is that a solid
compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent that can dissolve all or most of any impurities but very little
of the compound being purified. The steps used in a typical purification are:
«    Add the impure solid to a conical flask.
«    Add some of the chosen solvent and warm until the mixture nears the boiling temperature of
     the mixture.
276   20A.5   PRACTICAL   TECHNIQUES:       PART                              TOPIC 20

                              «      If there is still some undissolved solid, add further solvent and warm until the mixture boils again.
                              +      Continue adding further solvent and heating until all of the soluble solid has dissolved.
                              +      If insoluble impurities are present, then hot filtration could be done using fluted filter paper in a
                                     heated funnel.
                              +      Allow the liquid to cool until crystals of the organic solid have formed.
                              +      More crystals can be obtained by cooling the solution below room temperature in an ice bath.
                               +     The mixture is then filtered to remove soluble impurities using a Buchner funnel or a Hirsch
                                     funnel (fig C).
                               *     The crystals are washed with a small amount of ice-cold solvent and then dried in a desiccator
                                     or warm oven.



                                   LEARNING TIP
                                   The impure solid needs to be dissolved in the minimum volume of hot solvent. This is to make sure that the
                                   pure solid will crystallise when the solution is cooled.
                                   Hot filtration is used to make sure that the pure solid does not crystallise at this stage.
                                   Crystals of the pure solid form when the solution is cooled. This is because the solid is less soluble in the
                                   cold solvent than in the hot solvent.
                                   The crystals are washed with a small amount of ice-cold solvent. This is to remove any soluble impurities,
                                   and to make sure that very little of the pure solid dissolves.

                                   Study the information about recrystallisation carefully. Many students do not understand why there might
                                   be two filtrations needed. Some throw away the substance they have just purified!


                               TESTING FOR PURITY
                               Having prepared an organic compound, a simple test can be performed to give an indication of

DETERMINATION OF MELTING TEMPERATURE
For solids, impurities reduce the melting temperature. If you measure the melting temperature of
your organic compound, then you can compare it with the known value of the pure compound. This
will enable you to estimate how pure it is.

The traditional way to measure a melting temperature of a solid is to place some of the solid ina
small capillary tube attached to the bulb of a thermometer and then place the assembly in a liquid                -_
that has a boiling temperature above that of the melting temperature of the solid (fig D).                        ae                                     |

The boiling temperatures of pure organic compounds have been carefully measured and are widely

available in data books and online. If you measure the boiling temperature of your organic compound,
you can compare the value you obtain with the known value of the pure compound and then estimate
how pure the compound is.

The apparatus used depends on the volume of liquid available, and whether it is toxic or flammable.
The apparatus used for simple distillation can be used in most cases.

A word of caution. This test may not be enough proof because you may not be able to measure the
boiling temperature of your organic compound accurately enough — your thermometer might read
too low or too high. So, even if your measured boiling temperature exactly matches the one in the
data book or online, you may wrongly assume that your compound is pure.

It is also worth remembering that different organic compounds can, by coincidence, have the same
boiling temperature. For example, both 1-chloropentane and 2-methylpropan-1-ol boil at 108 °C.

                                         CALCULATING LOGARITHMS

                                         Many formulae in science and mathematics involve powers. Consider the equation:

                                                  10*
                                                   = 62

                                         The value of x obviously lies between 1 and 2, but how can you find a precise answer? The term
                                         logarithm means ‘index’ or ‘power’. Logarithms enable you to solve such equations. You can take the
                                         logarithm to base 10 of each side of the equation using the log button of a calculator

                                         Many equations relating to the natural world involve powers of e. These are called exponentials. The
                                         logarithm to base e is referred to as the natural logarithm and written In.

                                         An earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale is much more than twice as powerful as an
                                         earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, because the units used for measuring earthquakes
                                         are logarithmic. Logarithmic scales in charts and graphs can accommodate enormous increases or
                                         decreases in one variable as another variable changes.

GRAPHS
UNDERSTANDING THAT y = mx + c REPRESENTS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP
Two variables have a linear relationship if they increase at a constant rate in relation to one another. If
you plot a graph with one such variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis, you get a straight line.

Any linear relationship can be represented by the equation y = mx + c, where the gradient of the line
is m and the value at which the line crosses the y-axis is c. An example of a linear relationship is that
between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit, which can be represented by the equation F = 9/5C
+ 32, where Cis temperature in degrees Celsius and F is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

USING THE GRADIENT AS A MEASURE OF A RATE OF CHANGE

Sir Isaac Newton drew tangents to curves on graphs to find the rates of change of the variables as
part of his journey towards discovering calculus, a fascinating branch of mathematics. He stated that
the gradient of a curve at a given point is exactly equal to the gradient of the tangent to the curve at
that point.

To find the gradient at a point on a curve:
1    Use a ruler to draw a tangent to the curve at that point.

2 Calculate the gradient of the tangent using the equation for a linear relationship. This gradient is
  equal to the gradient of the curve at the point of the tangent.
3    Include the unit with your answer.

                                     (a) To answer this question you need to find the value for the concentration of reactant 1 when the
                                              time is equal to zero. That is, you need to find the intercept with the y-axis of the line for the
                                              concentration of reactant 1. From the graph you can see that this is 0.85 mol dm.

                     (b)        In order to calculate the rate of change of by-product concentration during the reaction you
                                need to find the gradient of its line. The line is straight, meaning that there is a linear relationship
                               between the concentration and time. To find the rate of change you just have to find the gradient
                               of the line by dividing the change in concentration of by-product by the time taken for the
                               change. Since the line is straight you can choose any two values.

                               Take care to use the correct units. Concentration is in mol dm= but time is in minutes, so you must
                               convert time to seconds to get the correct answer.

                                     concentration after 8 minutes = 0.24 mol dm=?

                                     concentration after 12 minutes = 0.36 mol dm=3

                                     change of concentration = 0.12 mol dm
                                     time taken for change = 4 x 60 = 240s

                                                        change in concentration of by-product
                                     rate of change =
                                                                time taken for change

                  (c)_         To find the rate of change of the desired product is a little trickier because the line is curved. To
                               do this you need to draw a tangent to the curve and then calculate the gradient of the tangent.
                               A simple way to do this is to draw a triangle with the tangent as its hypotenuse, centred on the
                               10-minute point as asked (fig D).

PREPARING FOR YOUR EXAMS
IAS AND IAL OVERVIEW
The Pearson Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary (IAS) in Chemistry and the Pearson Edexcel International Advanced
Level (IAL) in Chemistry are modular qualifications. The IAS can be claimed on completion of the International Advanced
Subsidiary (IAS) units. The International Advanced Level can be claimed on completion of all the units (IAS and IAL units).

+ International AS students will sit three exam papers. The IAS qualification can either be standalone or contribute 50% of
  the marks for the International Advanced Level.

+ International A Level students will sit six exam papers, the three IAS papers and three IAL papers.

Question analysis

e    Multiple-choice questions may require simple recall, as in
     this case, but sometimes a calculation or some other form
     ofanalysis will be required.

e    In multiple-choice questions you are given the correct
     answer along with three incorrect answers (called
     distractors). You need to select the correct answer and put
     a cross in the box of the letter next to it.

e    The three distractors supplied will feature the answers that
     you are likely to arrive at if you make typical or common
     errors. For this reason, multiple-choice questions aren’t as
     easy as you might at first think. If possible, try to answer
     the question before you look at any of the answers.

e    Ifyou change your mind, put a line through the box with
     the incorrect answer (<}) and then mark the box for your
     new answer with a cross ([X)) -

     choice questions should be put high on your list of                 The student has selected the wrong answer. They haven't

     priorities for checking answers.

Question analysis

e     The command word in this question is ‘explain’. This
      requires a justification/exemplification of a point,
      which in this case is that chlorine has undergone
      disproportionation. In some cases of this type of
      question, a mathematical explanation could also be used.


    Student answer

    In ClO,, chlorine has an oxidation state of +4. When it
    reacts, its oxidation state changes to +3 in CIO} and +5 in
    C103. This means that its oxidation state has both
    increased and decreased in the same reaction. That is to
    say, it has been reduced and oxidised at the same time.


COMMENTARY
This is an excellent answer because:
e     The answer is logically structured.

e     The student has calculated all three oxidation states
      correctly and shown that they understand the term
      disproportionation.

     for structuring your answer well, with clear lines of
     reasoning and linkages between points.

e    Itis vital to plan out your answer before you write it
     down. There is always space given on an exam paper to
     do this, so just jot down the points that you want to make
     before you answer the question in the space provided.
     This will help to ensure that your answer is coherent and
     logical and that you don’t end up contradicting yourself.

COMMENTARY
This is a poor answer because:
e The student should have stated what happens when both
     acid and alkali are added to this solution and how this
     will not affect the pH significantly. When acid is added,
     the H* ions will react with HCO; ions. When alkali
     is added, the OH ions will react with CO, molecules.
     The pH of the solution is determined by the ratio of the

     both of these two concentrations are relatively large, then
     this ratio will not change significantly when either H* or

QUESTION ANALYSIS
e A synoptic question is one that addresses ideas from
     different areas of chemistry in one context. In your
     answer you need to use these different ideas and show
     how they combine to explain the chemistry in the context
     of the question.
e    Questions in Paper 3 may draw on any of the topics
     in this specification. This question is assessing
     understanding of experimental methods.


    Student answer
                                                                        The student has calculated the percentage uncertainty
    Percentage uncertainty of pipette = 0.06 x 100/25 = 0.24%
                                                                        correctly for each piece of apparatus. However, they have
    Percentage uncertainty of volumetric flask                          forgotten that the percentage for the burette needs to be
                                        = 0.2 x 100/250 = 0.08% €— doubled because this reading is taken twice and therefore
    Percentage uncertainty of burette                                   the error will be doubled. This has lost them one mark. This

    The pipette has the greatest percentage uncertainty.


COMMENTARY
This is a good answer because:
e The student has used the correct formula to calculate the
     percentage uncertainty. There is only one error, and that
     is not doubling the percentage for the burette. This is
     penalised only once.
